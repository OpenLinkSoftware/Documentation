      <title>ASMX Web Service Hosting</title>
      <para>Microsoft ASMX Web Services can be hosted in exactly the same way as 
  ASPX Applications can be.  A ASMX Web Services Project created in Visual Studio
  can be copied to either the file system (under the VSPROOT directory) or the 
  Virtuoso WebDAV repository.  You must copy the project directory to the 
  required location and then make a Virtual Directory pointing to it.  If the 
  location is in WebDAV then ensure that execute permissions are set for 
  any .asmx files.</para>
