        <para>
A majority of the worlds data naturally resides in non RDF form at the current time. The Sponger
delivers middleware that accelerates the bootstrap of the Semantic Data Web by generating RDF
from non RDF data sources, unobtrusively. This "Swiss army knife" for on-the-fly Linked Data generation
provides a bridge between the traditional Document Web and the Linked Data Web ("Data Web").
</para>
        <para>Sponging data from non-RDF Web sources and converting it to RDF exposes the data in a
canonical form for querying and inference, and enables fast and easy construction of linked
data driven mesh-ups as opposed to code driven Web 2.0 mash-ups.
</para>
        <para>The RDF extraction and instance data generation products that offer functionality
demonstrated by the Sponger are also commonly referred to as RDFizers.
