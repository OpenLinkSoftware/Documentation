### 9.19.5.Â Ordering and Grouping

</div>

</div>

</div>

The result rows of a query can be ordered based on their column values.
The ORDER BY phrase allows specifying an ascending or descending sort
order for a any column. The SQL interpreter will use an index if there
is an index whose order reflects the order in the ORDER BY clause. If
there is no appropriate index or if ascending and descending order is
combined for columns of the same table the SQL interpreter will first
evaluate the query and then sort the results before returning them.

<div>

|                            |                                           |

``` programlisting
 select * from Employees order by BirthDate;
```

will list all employees, oldest first, in ascending order of birth date.

The GROUP BY clause allows computing functions over repeating groups.
Without the GROUP by clause set functions (AVG, MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT)
may not be mixed with normal columns in a selection list. If set
functions and columns are mixed, all the columns must appear in the
GROUP BY section. Such a query will produce as many rows as there are
distinct value combinations of the grouping columns. The set functions
will be computed for each distinct column combination.

``` programlisting
select OrderID, sum (UnitPrice * Quantity)
   from Order_Details group by OrderID
   having sum (UnitPrice * Quantity) > 5000  order by 2 desc;
```

Produces the OrderID and total value of the order in decreasing order of
order value. The HAVING clause specifies that only orders with a value
\> 5000 will be counted. Note that the sum expression in having must be
written identically to the same expression in the SELECT left.

The 2 in the order by refers to the second column of the select, which
has no name, it being a function reference.

#### CUBE and ROLLUP

</div>

</div>

</div>

Virtuoso database offers a way to increase efficiency of SQL summary
queries and simplify the operations. By using the options `ROLLUP` and
`CUBE` in `GROUP BY` , can be executed more comprehensive summary
operations. The produced result sets could be also produced without
using these option but rahter with additional coding and queries.

The options `ROLLUP` and `CUBE` extend the result set of `GROUP BY` :

<div>

- `ROLLUP` : builds a consequence of subtotal aggregates on every
  queried level including the grand total.

- `CUBE` : this option is an extension of

  `ROLLUP` . It builds all possible subtotal aggregates combinations for
  given

  `GROUP BY` .

</div>

For example:

``` programlisting
  SELECT j, grouping (j), k, grouping (k), t, grouping (t), SUM (i)
    FROM MyDemo
GROUP BY ROLLUP (j,k,t);

  SELECT j, grouping (j), k, grouping (k), t, grouping (t), SUM (i)
    FROM MyDemoCube
GROUP BY CUBE (j,k,t);
```

The `grouping(param)` procedure returns "1" if the column "param" is not
in the dynamic GROUP BY set, and returns "0" otherwise.

The result set of:

``` programlisting
  SELECT j, k, t, SUM (i)
    FROM MyDemo
GROUP BY ROLLUP (j,k,t) ;
```

is equivalent of the accumulated result sets of:

``` programlisting
  SELECT j, k, t, SUM (i)
    FROM MyDemo
GROUP BY j,k,t;

  SELECT NULL, k, t, SUM (i)
    FROM MyDemo
GROUP BY k,t;

  SELECT NULL, NULL, t, SUM (i)
    FROM MyDemo
GROUP BY t;

  SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, SUM (i)
    FROM MyDemo;
```

The result set of:

``` programlisting
SELECT t,s, SUM (i) FROM MyDemo GROUP BY CUBE (t,s);
```

is equivalent of the accumulated result set of:

``` programlisting
  SELECT t,s, SUM (i)
    FROM MyDemo
   GROUP BY t,s;

  SELECT t,NULL, SUM (i)
    FROM MyDemo
GROUP BY t;

  SELECT s,NULL, SUM (i)
    FROM MyDemo
GROUP BY s;

  SELECT NULL,NULL, SUM (i)
    FROM MyDemo;
```
