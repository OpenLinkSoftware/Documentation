### 16.5.12.Â Split Linked Data View

</div>

</div>

</div>

Linked Data View can be created by two or more "sparql alter storage"
statements. In each statement can be created one quad map that contains
mappings for half or a third of all tables. Quad maps created should
have distinct names but may mention same graph. The important fact is
that if the Linked Data View in question is exclusive for a graph then
only the last quad map should be exclusive but all previous should not
have this option. This is because if a map is exclusive on a graph the
rest of maps on that graph will be silently ignored.

The example below shows a sample part of the Virtuoso eCRM Views code,
where the Linked Data View is split in two parts: with quad map
virtrdf:ecrmDemo1 and with quad map virtrdf:ecrmDemo2:
