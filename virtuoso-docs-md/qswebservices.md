SOAP is a lightweight, extensible, XML-based protocol for information
exchange in a decentralized, distributed environment. Primarily, SOAP
defines a framework for message structure and a message processing
model. SOAP also defines a set of encoding rules for serializing data
and a convention for making remote procedure calls. The SOAP
extensibility model provides the foundation for a wide range of
composable modules and protocols running over a variety of underlying
protocols such as HTTP.

implementation effort. Development is very rapid and is directly
incorporated within the database environment required for keeping B2B
processes running accurately.
