type is started with '--', the rest of string is the text of an

The type identifier 'CalculateableValue' is introduced only for
diagnostic purposes, you will never use it in VSPX code. When Virtuoso
server tries to compile an invalid VSPX page, you might see a diagnostic
messages like 'the value of attribute X of a control Y does not match
pattern ... for type CalculateableValue'. If you see this then you
should check the syntax of the value of the specified attribute.
