## 5.4. Web Services Protocol Support

</div>

</div>

</div>

The Internet is reaching a stage where automatic processes want to rely
on other sites and services presenting their uses in a standard way.
This is Web Services. What ever an organization or repository of data
contains the it needs to be exploited as fully as possibly. This is
exposing existing systems as Web Services. These need to be accessible
over well known protocols which combine to provide a service over the
web.

SQL provides the means to query data within a database. This is a very
well known and supported operation. The query may or may not be able to
make use of free text indexes to obtain results faster and more
accurately from textual sources. The source could even come from a
remote database contacted over ODBC, JDBC or OLEDB - more well supported
standards. The results may be shipped to another server for further
processing. Further processing could include transformations into
various XML's directly or via an XSLT stylesheet. This collaboration of
services can be enhanced further with other Web and Internet protocols
for the grand objective of making parts of useful information or ability
consumable over the Internet as a Web Service.
