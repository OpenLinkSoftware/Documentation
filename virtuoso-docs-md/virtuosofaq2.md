The more triples are inserted at a time, the faster this goes. Also, the
more concurrent triple insertions are going on, the better the
throughput. When loading data such as the US Census, a cluster of 2
commodity servers can insert up to 100,000 triples per second.

A single 4-core machine can load 1 billion triples of LUBM data at an
average rate of 36K triples per second. This is limited by disk.
