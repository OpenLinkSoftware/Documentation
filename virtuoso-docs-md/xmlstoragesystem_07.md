Every blogger read and link to it's blog a many other sources, which are
usually RSS feeds or other Web content. As RSS feeds (doesn't matter in
which format RSS/RDF) are common practice to offer XML data from blogs,
this is preferable source for most of the bloggers. The utilities for
collecting such data are known as aggregators.

The blogging support implements a own channel/blog aggregator, so
bloggers may import RSS as specifying a URL to it, or using a directory
formats as OCS and OPML. Secondly the channel feeds requested by blogger
will be refreshed on a periodic basis (depending of channel parameters)
and will feed the data locally. Once the channel is refreshed a blogger
may do "BlogThis!" when browsing the local copy of the channel. This
function is available via Admin UI - Weblog UI, or via "Channels" on
blog home page when owner is authenticated.
