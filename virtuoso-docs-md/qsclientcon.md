### 3.2.1. ODBC

</div>

</div>

</div>

The Virtuoso driver for ODBC is available for Windows and most Unix
operating systems. For Windows the you can configure a data source that
utilizes the driver in the familiar way via the ODBC Administrator. This
is very easy windows and wizards based process. On Unix the process has
historically not been so simple. We have been trying to a achieve the
same level of usability under Unix through our support of the
<a href="http://www.iodbc.org/" class="ulink" target="_top">iODBC
project</a> . For more information and details about how to configure
the Virtuoso driver for ODBC please go to the

ODBC</a> section.
