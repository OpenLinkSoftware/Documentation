### 16.17.6.Â Using "swappiness" parameter ( Linux only )

</div>

</div>

</div>

<span class="emphasis">*For Linux users only*</span> , there is a kernel
tuning parameter called "`swappiness` " that controls how much the
kernel favors swap over RAM.

When hosting large data sets, it is recommended that this parameter be
changed from its default value of 60 to something closer to 10, to
reduce the amount of swapping that takes place on the server. Useful
tidbits regarding swappiness include:

<div class="itemizedlist">

- The swappiness setting is found in the file `/proc/sys/vm/swappiness`
  .

- The command `/sbin/sysctl vm.swappiness` can be used to view its
  setting.

- The command `/sbin/sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10` can be used to change
  its value.

- Adding `vm.swappiness = 10` to the file `/etc/sysctl.conf` will force
  the value to be set at machine boot time.
