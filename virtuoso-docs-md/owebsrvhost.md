Enables the creation of <span class="emphasis">*SOAP*</span> compliant
Web Services from SQL Stored Procedures, these procedures may be native
to Virtuoso or resident in third party databases that support ODBC or
JDBC. Virtuoso automatically generates
<span class="emphasis">*WSDL*</span> files for the Stored Procedures
that it exposes as Web Services. As a
