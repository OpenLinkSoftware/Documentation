<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/" class="ulink"
target="_top">R2RML</a> is a language for expressing customized mappings
from relational databases to RDF data sets. Such mappings provide the
ability to view existing relational data in the RDF data model,
expressed in a structure and target vocabulary of the mapping author's
choice.

R2RML mappings are themselves RDF graphs written in Turtle syntax.
