### 3.3.2.Â Datasource Check

</div>

</div>

</div>

Before trying to link a table into Virtuoso, you should verify that the
datasource is working correctly. Use a tool such as Microsoft Access, or
ODBCtest to test your datasource. Your sanity check will verify that the
datasource is correctly configured, that all necessary software is
installed, that the database is running, and that there are no
permission related problems. In addition, it will verify that the driver
that you are using works correctly with the underlying datasource.

If there is a problem using a specific tool such as Microsoft Access
with a specific driver, then that same problem will be manifested when
the datasource is exposed via Virtuoso.
