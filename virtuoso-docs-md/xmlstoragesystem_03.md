In many cases many people needs authoring in common blog. For that case
web admin have to create a blog which is owned by "group" (not by web
user) and then granting this role to users which are authors will give
them access to post on that blog. As group cannot be authenticated, thus
it's not possible to login as group and post on behalf of it; the post's
author have to be a valid web user account. This feature does not
contradict with possibility authors to have their own blogs, they can
have own and post to many "group" blogs. Granting access to a "group"
blog can be done via WebDAV users UI, or with GRANT statement via ISQL
tool.
