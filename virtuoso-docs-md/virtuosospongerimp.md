A majority of the worlds data naturally resides in non RDF form at the
current time. The Sponger delivers middleware that accelerates the
bootstrap of the Semantic Data Web by generating RDF from non RDF data
sources, unobtrusively. This "Swiss army knife" for on-the-fly Linked
Data generation provides a bridge between the traditional Document Web
and the Linked Data Web ("Data Web").

Sponging data from non-RDF Web sources and converting it to RDF exposes
the data in a canonical form for querying and inference, and enables
fast and easy construction of linked data driven mesh-ups as opposed to
code driven Web 2.0 mash-ups.

The RDF extraction and instance data generation products that offer
functionality demonstrated by the Sponger are also commonly referred to
as RDFizers.
