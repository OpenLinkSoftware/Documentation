Assume the Virtuoso server is not responding to HTTP requests although
SQL connection is working. In order to determine what activity is being
performed that might account for this:

1.  Check the status:

    ``` programlisting
    SQL> status('');
    REPORT

2.  Connect with the PL debugger and see what is running currently using
    the info threads call:

    ``` programlisting
    $ isql 1111 dba <password> -D
    DEBUG> info threads
    ```

3.  This should return the current code being executed by the Sever.

4.  Run
    <a href="fn_txn_killall.html" class="link" title="txn_killall"><code
    class="function">txn_killall()</code></a> to kill any pending
    transactions which may enable the server to start responding to HTTP
    requests again:

    ``` programlisting

    SQL> txn_killall();

    Done. -- 866 msec.
    ```
