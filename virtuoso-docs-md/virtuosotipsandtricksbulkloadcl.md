The cluster
<a href="fn_cl_exec.html" class="link" title="cl_exec">cl_exec()</a>
function is used to perform a checkpoint across all node of a Virtuoso
cluster as follows:

``` programlisting
SQL>cl_exec ('checkpoint');
```

This typically needs to be run after loading RDF datasets into a
Virtuoso cluster to prevent lose of data when the cluster is restarted.
