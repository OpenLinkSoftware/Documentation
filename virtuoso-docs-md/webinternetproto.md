Virtuoso provides direct access to a number of Internet protocols
through built in procedures. These protocols include SMTP, NNTP, POP3,
HTTP, XML and many more. Combined with Virtuoso's native database and
virtual database capabilities applications can be developed very rapidly
from scratch or existing systems can be enhanced with a rich set of
tools. An old customer table can be used to create a mail shot; a
products table can now generate an XML file which can be converted to
plain text and or HTML via XSLT which can be emailed to the customers
every week automatically using the scheduler, or on request from a VSP
page served by the HTTP server. The possibilities are endless and all
these abilities are contained within a single server.
