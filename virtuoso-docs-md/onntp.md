</div>

Virtuoso supports the Network News Transfer Protocol used by Internet
newsgroup forums. <span class="emphasis">*NNTP*</span> servers manage
the global network of collected newsgroup postings and represent a vast
repository of targeted information archives. As an NNTP aggregator,
Virtuoso enables integration of multiple news forums around the world.
All news content in Virtuoso is dynamically indexed to provide keyword
searches, enabling rapid transformation of disparate text data into
information. Virtuoso also acts as an NNTP server, enabling creation of
new Internet and Intranet News Forums to leverage the global
knowledgebase into eBusiness Intelligence.
