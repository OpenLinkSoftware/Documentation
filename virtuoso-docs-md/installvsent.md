**Virtuoso Entity Framework School DB Windows Form Application. ** This
section demonstrates how Visual Studio 2008 can be used to generate
mapping files for an Entity Data Model (EDM), based on a 1:1 mapping to
tables in the School database. This will be done by creating a Windows
Forms application in Visual Studio, create queries that access data in
the School model, bind the query results to display controls to show the
results of the queries, and then make updates to objects and persist the
changes to the database.
