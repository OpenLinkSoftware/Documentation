The Virtuoso driver for JDBC is a type 4 native driver which is
available for all Java platforms. This means that you have a single jar
file, for which to include into your classpath, and then the driver is
ready for use by your applications. The connection URL typically
consists of:

``` programlisting
jdbc:virtuoso://hostname:port/UID=uid/PWD=pwd
```

More information about the JDBC driver can be found in the
<a href="virtuosodriverjdbc.html" class="link"
title="7.4. Virtuoso Driver for JDBC">Virtuoso Driver for JDBC</a>
section. The JDBC driver also supports SSL encrypted connections. This
JDBC driver is an excellent companion to any web enabled applications
especially when combined with Virtuoso's other features such as WSDL and
SOAP.
