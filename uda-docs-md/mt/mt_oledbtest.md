The connection can be tested using the sample application, "Rowset
Viewer" as follows:

<div class="orderedlist">

1.  Select <span class="emphasis">*Full Connect*</span> from the File
    menu

2.  Select <span class="emphasis">*OpenLink ODBC Provider*</span> for
    the connection provider

3.  Choose an ODBC <span class="emphasis">*Datasource*</span> either by
    typing the name directly or using the
    <span class="emphasis">*"..."*</span> button and selecting
    <span class="emphasis">*Enumerator*</span> from the submenu that
    appears in place of the button. In the new dialog that appears
    choose " <span class="emphasis">*OpenLink ODBC Data Source
    Enumerator*</span> " as the data source enumerator and click
    <span class="emphasis">*Connect*</span> . A list of ODBC data
    sources will appear, from which you can choose the one you want and
    click <span class="emphasis">*OK*</span> to confirm.

4.  Enter the <span class="emphasis">*UserID*</span> and
    <span class="emphasis">*Password*</span> and click on
    <span class="emphasis">*OK*</span> to connect.

5.  Once connected an "Command" subwindow will appears, into which you
    can submit SQL for test querying on the data source.
