A number of sample applications are bundled with your Universal Data
Access Driver Suite installation for the following purposes:

<div class="itemizedlist">

- To simplifying the process of getting the product up and running

- To accelerate the support case creation and resolution process

- To demonstrate the Data Access Driver Suite's unique product features
  highlighting the benefits it brings to your organization

- To demonstrate application programming techniques that can used to aid
  and assist your ODBC and JDBC programmers

</div>

The Universal Data Access Driver Suite services are consumed primarily
via ODBC and JDBC applications (OLE-DB applications connect via ODBC
Data Providers for OLE-DB), thus separate ODBC & JDBC sample
applications (including source code) have been packaged and integrated
into the installer. The current list of sample applications include:

<div class="itemizedlist">

- **C++ Demo. ** an ODBC based Interactive SQL processor written in C++.

- **ODBC Bench Test. ** a 32 Bit C++ program based on the industry
  standard TPC-A benchmark (we will be extending this program to include
  the TPC-C and TPC-D benchmarks also). This program helps you compare
  the performance of Virtuoso against other backend database engines as
  well as compare the performance of various ODBC Drivers connecting to
  any ODBC compliant backend database.

- **ODBCTEST. ** ODBC based Interactive SQL processor written in 'C' for
  Linux & UNIX

- **JDBCDemo. ** a JDBC sample application that demonstrates an SQL
  query.

- **Rowset Demo. ** a JDBC application that demonstrates OpenLink's JDBC
  Driver with the OpenLink Scrollable Cursor RowSet Extension to the
  JDBC specification.

- **ScrollDemo2. ** a JDBC 2.0 sample application that demonstrates
  OpenLink's support of Scrollable Cursors and its ability to perform
  scrollable cursor operations across heterogeneous databases.

- **JBench. ** a Java and JDBC based adaptations of the industry
  standard TPC-A benchmarks. This program helps you compare the
  performance of OpenLink's Virtuoso against other backend database
  engines, it also helps you to compare the performance of various JDBC
  Drivers connecting to any JDBC compliant backend database.
