### 6.2.1. Initial License

</div>

</div>

</div>

When you obtain a Data Access Driver from the OpenLink Web Site, a
license file will automatically be emailed to you. Please ensure the
email address you have provided is correct. If you obtained the Data
Access Driver from a CD, you may need to apply for an evaluation license
through our Web site, or by contacting one of our offices. The standard
license will provide 30 days to evaluate the product.

### 6.2.2. How to apply the License

</div>

</div>

</div>

You will be prompted for the location of your license file during the
initial installation. If you have not yet received a license file, you
may still install the product, and manually apply the license file when
you do receive it.

To use the license file, simply place it in one of the following
locations:

<div class="itemizedlist">

- Place the license file in the default location for your Operating
  System.

  <div class="itemizedlist">

  - For Linux and Unix - \$OPENLINK/bin.

  - For Windows -by default, C:\Program Files\OpenLink\bin. If you chose
    a different installation target directory, the bin directory beneath
    your choice.

  - For Mac OS X - //Library/Application Support/openlink/bin.

  - For Mac OS 9 or earlier - the Preferences folder, within the System
    Folder.

  </div>

- Alternatively, you may define the environment variable OPL_LICENSE_DIR
  to specify the directory in which all OpenLink license files can be
  found. (Does not apply to Mac OS 9 or earlier.)

- Finally, license files may reside in any directory included in the
  PATH environment variable of the host machine. (Does not apply to Mac
  OS 9 or earlier.)

</div>

License errors are generally found in the Request Broker log file,
oplrqb.log.

If your product fails to register properly, then your license may be
corrupt or invalid. Please check the license details against the name
and version of the Driver installed, and contact OpenLink Software
Technical Support for assistance.
