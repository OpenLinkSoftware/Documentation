### 1.1.1. About ODBC

</div>

</div>

</div>

Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a Microsoft standard for database
access. It provides a mechanism for desktop-based tools (word
processors, spreadsheets, report writers, Internet/Intranet tools, for
example) to transparently access data sources, such as databases.
OpenLink Software provides the drivers you need to access your data
sources from an ODBC compliant application.

### 1.1.2. How ODBC Works

</div>

</div>

</div>

A typical single-tier installation may consist of a database server, and
a client that comprises the client networking provided by the database
engine vendor and the OpenLink Lite ODBC driver. The client components
need to be installed on every PC that is going to access the data. The
ODBC driver must be accompanied by an application, such as Microsoft
Office, which will use the driver to access and manipulate the data.

The OpenLink drivers can be used with, among others, the following
software packages:

<div class="itemizedlist">

- Microsoft Excel

- Microsoft Word

- Microsoft Access

- Crystal Report Writer

- Microsoft FrontPage98 (web page development tool)

- Visual Basic, Visual C++

- All Visual Studio ADO components

</div>

All standard Microsoft Office applications use the Microsoft Query tool
to access data. This package must be installed in order for ODBC drivers
to work. Microsoft queries can be embedded in documents and spreadsheets
and easily reused and modified.

Crystal Report Writer is a stand-alone reporting tool that enables you
to write and graph reports. It employs a "click through" user interface.

### 1.1.3. What You Can Do With ODBC

</div>

</div>

</div>

Everyone can do something different with ODBC. Here are just a few
ideas:

<div class="itemizedlist">

- Customize reports directly in Microsoft Excel

- Create (e-)mailing lists in Microsoft Word

- Write and design reports in Crystal Reports

- Create custom reporting tools or data monitoring tools (like CorVu's
  Executive Alert) through applications written in Visual Basic, C++,
  Java, etc.

- Render on-line information using data driven web content.

- And much more.....
