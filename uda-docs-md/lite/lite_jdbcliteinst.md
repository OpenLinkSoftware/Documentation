## 8.3.Â OpenLink JDBC Driver (Single-Tier Lite Edition) Configuration

</div>

</div>

The JDBC Client Classes can be downloaded as part of the OpenLink Lite
Data Access bundle or separately by choosing JDBC as the client platform
on the web.

Before any connections can be made using JDBC for Lite you must ensure
that a Lite data source is configured correctly. Refer to the previous
chapters to correctly install and configure the Database vendors
communications layer and the corresponding OpenLink Lite driver.

Once the underlying OpenLink Lite Data Access Driver has been configured
correctly the following section should be followed to construct suitable
JDBC Connect Strings to connect to the database successfully.
