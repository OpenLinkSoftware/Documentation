<!--End of %TOC{}%--><h2><a name="A license is required for this agent"></a> A license is required for this agent</h2>
<p>Different licenses are required for different Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Database Agents.
 If you experience <b>A license is required</b> errors, contact your Account Manager.
 They can provide you with the appropriate license file.</p>
<p>If you have a current license file, <a href="http://wikis.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/SupportWeb/ApplyingLicenseFiles" class="wikiword">follow the relevant instructions</a> to activate it.</p>
<h2><a name="Client access is restricted by license"></a> Client access is restricted by license</h2>
<p>Licensees must take account of all applications in the environment that use our data access products, and the data access mechanisms (ODBC, JDBC, OLE-DB, ADO.NET, XMLA, and others) they use.</p>
<p>Sales will generate a license that covers the necessary APIs and/or data access mechanisms.
 Failure to license all the required mechanisms will result in the &quot;Client access&quot; error.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Duplicate Serial Number"></a> Duplicate Serial Number</h2>
<p>The <b>duplicate serial number</b> error message arises when two or more environments are running with the same serializd license file.</p>
<p>To resolve the conflict, ensure that each licensed environment has an individually serialized license file.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Exceeded maximum number of licensed connections"></a> Exceeded maximum number of licensed connections</h2>
<p>This error is <a href="http://wikis.openlinksw.com/UdaWikiWeb/ExceededMaximumNumberOfAllowedConnections" class="absuri">discussed in the UDA Knowledgebase</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="License file oledb_lt.lic was not found for this product"></a> License file oledb_lt.lic was not found for this product</h2>
<p>Our <i><b>Lite Edition (Single-Tier) OLE-DB Provider for ODBC Data Sources</b></i> is licensed separately from all other products.</p>
<p>If you encounter *License file oledb_lt.lic was not found for this product* errors, take the following action:</p>
<ol><li>Ensure that you have a temporary or permanent <code>oledb_lt.lic</code> license file.
</li>
<li>Ensure that the license file has been transferred with binary preserving methods.
 Use of ASCII transfer may corrupt license files.
</li>
<li>Ensure that the license resides in the same directory as the OLE DB provider.
</li>
<li>Ensure that the directory is passed to the System and User PATHs.
</li>
<li>Finally, if the problem persists, contact <nop></nop>OpenLink Product Support.</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<h2><a name="No valid license was found"></a> No valid license was found</h2>
<h3><a name="General Problem"></a> General Problem</h3>
 <p><b>No valid license was found</b> errors tend to arise from one of three scenarios:</p>
<ol><li>The target machine contains more logical processors than the license permits.
 Users must obtain licensing for all logical processors.
</li>
<li>Hyperthreading can cause the <nop></nop>OpenLink License Manager (<code>oplmgr</code>) to detect more logical processors than physical cores exist in the machine.
 Users may disable hyperthreading or upgrade their license to accommodate the logical processor count.
 Contact Product Support for additional information.
</li>
<li>The license pertains to a major release of software which differs from the major release of the software installed on the machine.
 Users must contact our Sales or Support team to obtain an appropriate license.</li>

<ol><li>Ensure that you have a valid <nop></nop>OpenLink license file.
</li>
<li>Ensure that the license file is placed in the same directory as an <nop></nop>OpenLink Single-Tier client driver or an <nop></nop>OpenLink Multi-Tier server components installation.
</li>
<li>Ensure that binary ftp was used to transfer any license.
 ASCII ftp corrupts licenses.
</li>
<li>Ensure that openlink.sh or openlink.csh was run from the root of the relevant <nop></nop>OpenLink installation.
 openlink.sh is compatible with bourne and bash shells.
 openlink.csh is compatible with C shells.
 This sets ODBCINI, ODBCINSTINI, and other environment variables that facilitate ODBC connectivity.
</li>
<li>Use <code>echo $OPL_LICENSE_DIR</code> to confirm whether the <code>OPL_LICENSE_DIR</code> environment variable is set, and what its value is.
 If not set, export the variable from the commandline.
 It must point to the directory(ies) that contain(s) your <nop></nop>OpenLink license file.
 For example: <br><pre><br>export OPL LICENSE_DIR=/usr/openlink/bin:/opt/openlink/licenses
</pre><br></li>
<li>Ensure that you can establish basic ODBC connections using simple applications like odbctest or iodbctest.
</li>
<li>Ensure that the environment variables set in Step #4 are available at the time HSODBC is run.
</li>
<li>Add OPL LICENSE_DIR to the inithsodbc.ora file, if licensing problems persist.
 You may also set other environment variables like ODBCINI, the Single-Tier OPENLINKINI, and so on in inithsodbc.ora, as needed.
</li>
<li>Test.</li>

<h2><a name="This evaluation copy has expired"></a> This evaluation copy has expired</h2>
<p> &quot;This evaluation copy has expired&quot; errors will occur, if you do not obtain a license for your <nop></nop>OpenLink Single-Tier drivers.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Single-Tier drivers must be licensed after the evaluation period has expired.</p>
<p>If you have obtained a Single-Tier license -- and you continue to experience registration errors -- you may have received an inappropriate license key.
 Please forward a copy of your license and your driver version to <nop></nop>OpenLink Product Support.
 Be advised -- certain Progress Large Client drivers register with Progress Small Client keys.
 Ask Product Support for guidance.</p>
<p>If you are certain that you have obtained the correct license, you may have a corrupt registry.
 You will need to uninstall your <nop></nop>OpenLink Single-Tier driver, remove references to the driver from your registry, and reinstall.
 Subsequent attempts to register the Single-Tier driver should succeed.</p>

<h2><a name="You need to upgrade your license to run this software"></a> You need to upgrade your license to run this software</h2>
<p>This error is typically seen in two situations --</p>
<p>* when the license is for an earlier version of the software than is being used -- for example, when a Release 5.x license is being used with a Release 6.x driver.</p>
<p>* when the license is for a smaller number of logical processors than the machine reports to our components -- for example, when a 1 (one) CPU license is used on a dual-core machine.</p>
<p>To resolve this error, provide your Account Manager with the number of processor cores in your machine, and indicate whether hyperthreading is active.
 Also provide the version(s) of the <a href="http://wikis.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/SupportWeb/OpenLink" class="wikiword">OpenLink</a> component(s) you&#39;re trying to use, and a copy of the current license file.
 Your Account Manager will provide an appropriate temporary license for testing, and assess whether any additional fees will be due before provision of a new permanent license.</p>
