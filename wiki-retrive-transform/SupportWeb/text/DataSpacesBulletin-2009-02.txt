<p align="center">A monthly newsletter dedicated to the promotion of best practices 
 and education in the data access and integration communities.</p>

<p align="center">Brought to you by the team at <nop>OpenLink Software</p>

<p align="center">February 2009</p>


Dear <nop>OpenLink Community,

The RDBMS is dead! Long live the RDBMS!

Just kidding.  The RDBMS is alive and well.  It's longevity in the data 
management space is assured.  However, its position in that space is in 
question.  The team at <nop>OpenLink Software has seen the future, and in that 
future the RDBMS is no longer the dominant force.  The Closed World attitude 
that fostered the rise of the RDBMS is losing sway as well.


<nop>OpenLink is pleased to treat early adopters, futurenauts, curious onlookers 
and assorted others to a sneak peak of the new data management landscape.  
Read this month's newsletters and get your Open World, Web-as-Database 
bearings straight.

---++++Data Access and Data Management Value Redefined

Straight from the horse's mouth -- <nop>OpenLink President & CEO Kingsley Idehen 
explains the decline of the RDBMS in the face of a more agile model.  This 
model links data from diverse databases with heterogeneous schemas spanning 
the Enterprise, Web, and Internet as a whole -- all the while retaining 
conceptual and contextual lenses on that data.

---++++New Faceted Browsing Demo 

Traditional full text pattern searches are falling away as rapidly as the 
RDBMS.  Pattern searches offer astonishing numbers of hits, but their utility 
ends there.  These search methods cannot present any of the context or 
conceptual nature of the data behind their results, because they work only 
with text literals.  Servers conducting these searches "guesstimate" matches 
after milliseconds of processing -- and thus, a vast percentage of reported 
"hits" are generally not hits at all.  They are irrelevant or non-existent.

Learn how "Faceted Browsing" facilitates meaningful data access and highly 
relevant hits through its interrogation of entity descriptions.  Learn how 
use of interactively configurable search times control just how much data 
is searched so that those "million" hits represent real data.

---+++Tech Tricks & Tips - Post-RDBMS Edition

If the RDBMS come-down is news to you, take time to familiarize yourself 
with these other new changes in the data management milieu.
   

---++++Repeat After Me -- E-A-V

EAV is shorthand for Entity-Attribute-Value data model.  The EAV model 
breaks data out of the limiting two dimensional table logic of the RDBMS, 
into collections of entities that have values attributed to them.  Thus, 
many perceive EAV to provide true conceptual modeling of real world 
objects and information.  Early implementations of the EAV models had 
their own shortcomings including lack of standardization (query language, 
API), wire protocol implementation, scalability, and so on.  Neverthless, 
EAV had real staying power.  Limitations were outweighed by this model's 
ability to handle data split across heterogeneous DBMS engines, database 
schemas, networks, and the like.

Learn about advances in the EAV model which essentially seal its fate as 
the dominant DBMS model for the foreseeable future.

---++++Move Over Driver Manager 

It's time to get sponging with <nop>OpenLink's Virtuoso Universal Server!  The 
Sponger is part of the middleware package that comprises <nop>OpenLink's flagship 
product.  It functions much like the traditional Driver Manager in so far as 
it loads and unloads data extraction components -- called cartridges -- that 
pull data from various target data stores.  This data is then mapped back to 
various ontologies or schemas and is ultimately exposed as RDF Linked Data.  
Unlike single-API driver managers and drivers, the Sponger and its cartridges 
can extract data from iCal calendars, REST URLs, (X)HTML pages, mpegs, Excel 
spreadsheets, Word documents, and other data formats.

---++++The World is Your Spreadsheet ...

Shelve that spreadsheet software, and use Faceted Browsing to turn the Web 
into your next pivot table.  Not convinced?  Let <nop>OpenLink's Faceted Browsing 
demo expose the familiar Northwind database database in a way no spreadsheet 
ever could. While traditional spreadsheet packages will undoubtedly retain some place
in the foreseeable future, they will undoubtedly lose their primacy, as  Faceted Browsing 
wrests the task of Data Pivoting out of the grips of limited, platform-specific applications.

---++++And the Web is Your Database

See how a combination of a Web Browser, HTTP, and Linked Data URIs can turn 
Wikipedia into a structured data source:
