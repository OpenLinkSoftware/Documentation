  Apply License Files to Multi-Tier Release 6.x, on Unix 
#Navigate to the root directory of your OpenLink installation, where you find openlink.sh and openlink.csh.  
#Set the OpenLink environment by running the appropriate script for your shell. The following will work in most environments, but your required command may differ -- ****

  |  sh, bash, zsh and related |  . ./openlink.sh  |
 |  ksh and related |  source ./openlink.sh  |
 |  csh, tcsh and related |  source ./openlink.csh  |
   
#Execute these commands -- 
{{{
cd bin ./oplmgr +stop 
}}}
 
#Retrieve your new OpenLink license file(s) from an email or [[ODSBriefcaseLicenseStorage|ODS Briefcase]] .  
#Use binary ftp to transfer the new license file(s) to the Unix box, if required.  
#Place the new license file(s) in the /bin/ sub-directory of the OpenLink installation, replacing any same-named file(s).  
#Use the echo command to check the value of the the OPL_LICENSE_DIR environment variable. It should have been set by the openlink.sh script, above. If necessary, set and export this variable to include this directory. For example: 
{{{
% echo $OPL_LICENSE_DIR % export OPL_LICENSE_DIR=/usr/openlink/bin:$OPL_LICENSE_DIR 
}}}
**Note - you may set the OPL_LICENSE_DIR to target any directory(ies), as any PATH variable; all license file(s) must be found within. **   
#Execute this command to stop the running Request Broker 
{{{
./oplshut -fy 
}}}
 
#Wait for the Broker (oplrqb), the Admin Asst (www_sv), and any Agent (ora8_mv, inf9_sv, etc.) processes to terminate. You may wish to kill any which linger more than a few minutes (NOTE - users may lose some work if you do so). Then, execute the following commands to start the License Manager with the new license, and restart the Request Broker: 
{{{
./oplmgr +start ./oplrqb 
}}}
Your Broker start command may differ -- e.g., you may want to start in "Debug Mode" and test connections with the new license, to make sure all is as expected ? 
{{{
./oplrqb -dv 
}}}
