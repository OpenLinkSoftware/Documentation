  Apply Release 6.x Single-Tier License Files on Unix 
#For best results, quit all ODBC client applications and administrative tools to start this process, and do not relaunch any of them until instructed to test your connection.  
#Use the bash or sh command to open a bash or Bourne shell. (Other shells may be used, but vary widely, so any or all of the following steps may need adjustment.)  
#Retrieve your new OpenLink license file from an email or [[ODSBriefcaseLicenseStorage|ODS briefcase]] .  
#Use binary ftp to transfer the new license to the Unix box, if required.  
#Replace any existing license file with the new, or place the new license in your desired location. We generally recommend this location be the bin sub-directory of the OpenLink installation, or /etc/oplmgr/.  
#cd into the root of your OpenLink installation.  
#Check the openlink.sh and openlink.csh scripts, for their setting of the OPL_LICENSE_DIR environment variable. If necessary, adjust this to include the directory holding the new license file.  
#Execute this command: 
{{{
. ./openlink.sh 
}}}
 
#cd into the bin sub-directory of the OpenLink installation.  
#Execute these commands: 
{{{
./oplmgr +stop ./oplmgr +start 
}}}
 
#Test your connection with iodbctest, the HTTP-based [[OpenLink|OpenLink]] ODBC Administrator, or any other ODBC client application. 
#If license errors come up, reboot, and test again.  
#If errors persist, please [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp|log a Support Case]] .
