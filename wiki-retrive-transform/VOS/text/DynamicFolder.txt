---+ Dynamic Folders

A <i>dynamic folder</i>, also known as a <i>DAV Extension Type</i> or <i>DET</i>, is a WebDAV collection whose contents are determined at access time by program logic. It must at least offer a list of its contents and enable retrieval of that content with <code>GET</code>. Additionally, <code>PUT</code> may be used to add new resources or replace existing content.

The data accessed in a dynamic folder is typically not executable. The content may be all physical, all virtual, or a mixture of physical and virtual resources, as is the case with the <i>category view</i> (Item collection in Briefcase). Each dynamic folder exists as a physical collection in WebDAV, i.e., it has a corresponding row in <code><nowiki>SYS_DAV_COL</nowiki></code>, which is used to specify the hook functions used to make or manipulate the content.
