---+ Test of Upstream-Blocking Wiki Word

This is a test page, to confirm that any page labeled CategoryInternal will not be upstreamed.

Thoughts -- 

   * The upstream-blocking WikiWord should be user configurable.
   * It should be possible to have multiple upstream-blocking WikiWords.
   * These should be configurable both per-upstream-target, and per home-instance (that being where the original page resides).
