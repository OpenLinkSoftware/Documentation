---+++ 2013-04-24 -- Virtuoso 7.0 Unleashed!

Virtuoso 7.0 is a game-changing hybrid RDF & SQL Column-Store
DBMS for handling Big Data challenges associated with:

   * cost-effectiveness -- as result of new column-store
 data compaction technology 

   * performance -- array (vectorized) execution of queries
 across multiple threads per CPU core

   * scalability -- scale from multiple instances of Virtuoso
 per machine to multiple instances per collection of machines
 in a shared-nothing cluster

   * security -- use fine-grained access control lists (ACLs) and
 data access policies that are driven by entity relationship 
 semantics to control data access 

   * heterogeneous data integration -- merge data across a wide
 variety of data sources extending from existing SQL RDBMS
 systems to file servers and Web services.
