---+ Backing Up Individual Table(s) or Index(es) and Restoring Them to a Fresh DB

---++ What?

Selectively dumping a database table or its schema, for reload into a separate instance, or for recovery in the original instance.

<i><b>Note</b>: This is only possible with Virtuoso 6.0 and later.</i>


---++ Why?

There are many reasons, ranging from system corruption to migration, why you might want to reconstitute data across database management system instances.


---++ How to Dump and Recover one or more SQL Table(s)

   1 Create a function for dumping the key: 
<verbatim>
SQL> CREATE PROCEDURE bkp_key 
  ( IN  f         ANY
  , IN  tb_name   VARCHAR
  , IN  key_name  VARCHAR
  )
  {
    backup_prepare ( f ) ;
    backup_index ( tb_name
                 , key_name
                 );
    backup_flush ();
    backup_close ();
  };
</verbatim>
<i><b>Note:</b> You can dump multiple tables by adding more calls to the <code>backup_index</code> function.
   1 On the source DB, dump the <code>T1</code> table's primary key to a file named 
"<code>mylog.txn</code>", by executing: 
<verbatim>
SQL> bkp_key 
  ( 'mylog.txn'
  , 'DB.DBA.T1'
  , 'T1'
  );
</verbatim>
   1 On the source DB host, stop the Virtuoso server, and dump only the schema tables (no data) 
into the <code>trx</code> file, by executing: 
<verbatim>
% virtuoso +crash-dump +foreground +mode l   ## ( lower case L )
</verbatim>
   1 On the target DB host, make sure there is no existing <code>.db</code> file, and 
place the <code>.trx</code> file produced by previous step. Create a new DB with the
schema from the source DB, by executing: 
<verbatim>
% virtuoso +restore-crash-dump +foreground ;
</verbatim>
   1 Insert the PK data from the source DB dump into the new table in the new DB, 
by starting the new DB as normal, and executing: 
<verbatim>
SQL> replay ('mylog.txn') ;	
</verbatim>
<i><b>Note:</b> that this has only restored the Primary Key index.  If there are multiple indexes on the table(s), 
the other indexes must be dropped and re-created, as they will be empty at this point.</i>
