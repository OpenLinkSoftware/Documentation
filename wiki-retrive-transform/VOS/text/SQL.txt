---++Stuctured Query Language

Structured Query Language, also known as SQL, is an industry-standard language for creating, updating, and querying relational database management systems (RDBMS).

There are three basic components for SQL:

   * <b>Data Definition Language (DDL)</b> &mdash; for creation and modification  of relational schema as well as schema objects include relations, indexes, etc.
   * <b>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</b> &mdash; for inserting, deleting, and updating rows in tables, as well as querying data in tables
   * <b>Data Control Language (DCL)</b> &mdash; for concurrency control and transactions, as well as administrative tasks including the set up of database users and groups, table security permissions including grants and roles, etc.
