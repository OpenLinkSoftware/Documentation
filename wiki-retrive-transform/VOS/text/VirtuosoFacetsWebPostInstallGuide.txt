---++Faceted Browser post-installation Guide

DRAFT Version


as per Mitko I's implementation:

   * There are added a number of patches in binsrc/b3s re: making a fct_dav.vad.
   * The code run fine on v6single, next will try vos , probably we would need wrappers for cl_exec & dpipe_define in server code.
   * The current vad installs facet browser as it is on lod atm, except its VD is /fct/ to do not break eventual existing sites.
   * Also it needs a following indexes as in ~libsrc/Wi/clrdfinx2.sql
   * to have a HOWTO and users to make the indexes them-self .
