---+Crunchbase Cartridge - Configuration Guidelines

<b>Contents</b>
%TOC%

[[http://www.crunchbase.com/][Crunchbase]] is a free database of technology companies, people, and investors. 

The Sponger extractor cartridge for Crunchbase exposes Crunchbase entries as Linked Data. A corresponding meta-cartridge identifies company and people names in Linked Data and performs lookups against Crunchbase to further enrich this data with Crunchbase information.

The Crunchbase extractor and meta cartridges both require a Crunchbase API key. The same API key can be used for both cartridges.

---++Obtaining an API Key

To obtain an API key:
   * Go to the [[http://developer.crunchbase.com/][Crunchbase Developer Portal]]  and [[http://developer.crunchbase.com/member/register][register for a user account]]. 
   * After registering as a user, [[http://developer.crunchbase.com/apps/register][apply for an API key]].
   * In the "Crunchbase Application Registration" form: 
      * You can use any application name acceptable to Crunchbase, e.g. "Virtuoso Sponger".
      * Under the section "Select which Web APIs this application will use", ensure the "Issue a new key for Crunchbase API" checkbox is checked.
   * After clicking the "Register your application" button, your new Crunchbase API key will be displayed.

---++Configuring the Crunchbase extractor and meta cartridges

   * In the Conductor UI, click on the "Linked Data" tab, then the "Sponger" tab.
   * Under the "Extractor Cartridges" tab, select "Crunchbase" from the list of cartridges.
   * In the cartridge configuration form at the bottom of the page, enter your Crunchbase API key in the  "API Key" field, then confirm the update.
   * The Crunchbase meta cartridge is configured in a similar way to the extractor cartridge. Select the "Meta Cartridges" tab, select "Crunchbase" in the list of meta cartridges, then enter the Crunchbase API key in the "API Key" field.
