---+ Virtuoso "<nop>AnalyzeFixQuadStore" parameter for fixing RDF Quad Store Index corruption

Prior to Virtuoso version 6.3, some RDF data in the quad store could be 
stored in a way that could break the sequence of an index, causing wrong 
results to be passed back.

To fix this, we have added an automated check to detect whether
this condition is present, and to fix the index when needed.

When a DBA uses a Virtuoso 6.3 or later binary to start a database which 
was previously used only with Virtuoso 6.2 or earlier, the
following text will appear in the virtuoso session log:

<verbatim>
21:05:36 PL LOG: This database may contain RDF data that could cause indexing problems on previous versions of the server.
21:05:36 PL LOG: The content of the DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD table will be checked and an update may automatically be performed if
21:05:36 PL LOG: such data is found.
21:05:36 PL LOG: This check will take some time but is made only once.
</verbatim>

As noted, this check may take some time, depending on the number of stored
quads.  

If the check finds no issues, the following message is entered in the log, 
and Virtuoso will flag the check as "done," so it will not affect 
subsequent restarts of the database server. 

<verbatim>  
21:05:36 PL LOG: No need to update DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD
</verbatim>

The database will continue to perform the usual startup routines and go
into an online state.


If the problematic condition is detected, however, the following message will
appear in the log, and the Virtuoso server will refuse to start until its 
instructions are followed --

<verbatim>
21:05:36 PL LOG: An update is required.
21:05:36 PL LOG:
21:05:36 PL LOG: NOTICE: Before Virtuoso can continue fixing the DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD table and its indexes
21:05:36 PL LOG:         the DB Administrator should check make sure that:
21:05:36 PL LOG:
21:05:36 PL LOG:          * there is a recent backup of the database
21:05:36 PL LOG:          * there is enough free disk space available to complete this conversion
21:05:36 PL LOG:          * the database can be offline for the duration of this conversion
21:05:36 PL LOG:
21:05:36 PL LOG:         Since the update can take a considerable amount of time on large databases
21:05:36 PL LOG:         it is advisable to schedule this at an appropriate time.
21:05:36 PL LOG:
21:05:36 PL LOG: To continue the DBA must change the virtuoso.ini file and add the following flag:
21:05:36 PL LOG:
21:05:36 PL LOG:     [Parameters]
21:05:36 PL LOG:     AnalyzeFixQuadStore = 1
21:05:36 PL LOG:
21:05:36 PL LOG: For additional information please contact OpenLink Support <support@openlinksw.com>
21:05:36 PL LOG: This process will now exit.
</verbatim>

Since the update may take a substantial amount of time and additional
disk space (depending on the size of the quad store), we have
decided not to automatically start the update process.  Instead, 
we hand control back to the DBA and let them decide when to perform this
update. If the DBA wants to delay the update until a more
appropriate time, they should restart with the older binary as
the newer binary will never start the database.

Once the DBA has checked the backups and disk space, and found an
appropriate time-slot to run this update, they should edit the
<code>virtuoso.ini</code> file and add the following flag:
<verbatim>
[Parameters]
AnalyzeFixQuadStore = 1
</verbatim>

Upon starting the Virtuoso server with this parameter setting, the 
following messages will appear in the <code>virtuoso.log</code> file:
<verbatim>
21:05:57 PL LOG: This database may contain RDF data that could cause indexing problems on previous versions of the server.
21:05:57 PL LOG: The content of the DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD table will be checked and an update may automatically be performed if
21:05:57 PL LOG: such data is found.
21:05:57 PL LOG: This check will take some time but is made only once.
21:05:57 PL LOG:
21:05:57 PL LOG: An update is required.
21:05:57 PL LOG: Please be patient.
21:05:57 PL LOG: The table DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD and two of its additional indexes will now be patched.
21:05:57 PL LOG: In case of an error during the operation, delete the transaction log before restarting the server.

</verbatim>

If the update process detects any problem, it will put some debug
output into the <code>virtuoso.log</code> and exit. At this point, the DBA is
advised to remove the <code>virtuoso.trx</code> file and contact [[http://support.openlinksw.com/][OpenLink Support]].

After the update process has completed, the database will be left in an online state, as after a normal launch.
