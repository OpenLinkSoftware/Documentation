---+ <nowiki>OpenLink</nowiki> unleashes latest edition of Virtuoso  

---++ A Semantic Web Technology-based solution for Enterprise Information & Data Integration

Burlington, MA.  June 22, 2008 - <nowiki>OpenLink</nowiki> Software, Inc., 
announces the immediate availability of the latest edition of <nowiki>OpenLink</nowiki> Virtuoso,
its industry-acclaimed hybrid data-server and integration platform for 
SQL, XML, RDF, and Web Services. This release introduces a new approach 
to enterprise information and data-integration, leveraging recent 
advances in Semantic Web technology and the best practices of HTTP-based 
Linked Data across heterogeneous data sources. The new release provides 
a platform for declaratively developing and deploying conceptual views of 
disparate enterprise data sources such as SQL databases, XML and RDF data 
sources, and SOA-based Web services. 

Virtuoso enables end users, systems architects, systems integrators, 
and developers to interact with data at the conceptual as opposed to 
the traditional logical level.  Data about customers, suppliers, 
invoices, orders, etc., stored in existing ODBC- or JDBC-accessible 
database systems such as Oracle, Informix, Ingres, SQL Server, Sybase, 
Progress, <nowiki>PostgreSQL</nowiki>, or <nowiki>MySQL</nowiki>, 
can easily be presented in RDF form for use in Semantic Web applications.

---+++ New Features

   * Meta Schema language for exposing SQL, XML, and Web Service data as 
RDF Linked Data
   * On-the-fly transformation of Web Services into RDF Linked Data
   * SPARQL Query Language support, facilitating powerful holistic views and traversal 
of enterprise data relationships
   * Transparent integration of SPARQL and SQL, such that SPARQL is executable 
from SQL via ODBC, JDBC, OLE-DB, or ADO.NET
   * [[VirtSPARUL][Support for]] the [[http://jena.hpl.hp.com/~afs/SPARQL-Update.html][SPARQL/Update]] 
(SPARUL) extension of SPARQL
   * Data-referencing across database instance, machine, and network boundaries
   * Use of HTTP/1.1 transparent content-negotiation for unobtrusive 
injection of RDF-based Linked Data, projecting existing infrastructure 
into the broader Semantic Web without disrupting ongoing activities.
   * [[VOSRDFDataProviders][Storage Providers]] for [[VirtJenaProvider][Jena]], 
[[VirtSesame2Provider][Sesame]], [[VirtRDFDriverRedland][Redland]]
   * [[VOSArticleBISPARQL2][Business Intelligence Extensions for SPARQL]] -- 
expressions in results, aggregates, grouping, and derived tables.
   * Significant enhancements to the inference support, enabling 
[[VOSArticleWebScaleRDF][web-scale RDF support]]

---+++ [[VirtInstallationEC2][Amazon EC2 instance now also available]]

Newly available is an OpenLink Data Spaces AMI (Amazon Machine Image), bundling the Virtuoso 
Universal Server, [[Ods][OpenLink Data Spaces]] (ODS), 
[[http://wikis.openlinksw.com/owiki/OATWikiWeb/OATWikiWeb/OATWikiWebIndex][OpenLink Ajax Toolkit]] 
(OAT), and a collection of 3rd party applications (Wordpress, MediaWiki, phpBB3, and others).  In moments, 
the ODS AMI delivers --

   * Point of presence on the Linked Data Web that meshes your Identity and your Data via URIs
   * SPARQL endpoint for SPARQL Protocol based access to your Data
   * (X)HTML based Interactive SPARQL Query Builder for SPARQL Query By Example
   * (X)HTML based Linked Data Browser/Viewer
   * System generated Social Network Profile & Contact Data via FOAF
   * System generated global Data Space overview via SIOC
   * System generated OpenID and automatic integration with FOAF
   * Transparent Integration with Facebook
   * Transparent integration with Amazon S3 for data backup and restore
   * Built-in support for SyncML, enabling data synchronization with Mobile Phones

---++ Leadership via Innovative and Pragmatic use of Semantic Web Technology

"Effective combination of domain expertise with enterprise data-access 
and information-integration has been a challenging pursuit for 
organizations worldwide since the advent of the modern IT era," said 
Kingsley Idehen, Founder and CEO of <nowiki>OpenLink</nowiki> Software. "This release of Virtuoso 
introduces a new generation of Semantic Web technology innovation, leadership and 
pragmatism. Virtuoso delivers a technological solution that solves real business 
problems today - such as integrating data that is associated with a variety of disparate 
schemas, served by databases from a variety of vendors," he added.

Soeren Auer, of the DBpedia project, commented, "DBpedia provides a 
substrate for exposing knowledge buried in Wikipedia. Virtuoso enables 
us to serve the vast amount of DBpedia knowledge via Linked Data and 
SPARQL endpoints combining both performance and resilience."
