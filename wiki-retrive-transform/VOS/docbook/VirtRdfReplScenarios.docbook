 FARM-n and discuss a couple of common scenarios like adding an extra machine to the farm, or replacing a broken instance of MASTER.</para>
<para>In this example we will assume each virtuoso instance running on its own machine, so they can use the same port numbers for both the main server (default 1111) as well as the http port (default 8890) as each machine has an unique IP addresses.
 In the example we use <computeroutput>MASTER-IP</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>FARM-x-IP</computeroutput> which should be replaced by either the real IP address or the DNS name of the machine in question.</para>
<para>Since there will be a reverse-proxy service in front of the farm, all virtuoso instances should have the URIQA Default host set to the outside name for this service.
 In this example we will use <ulink url="http://test.example.com">http://test.example.com</ulink> as the web service we are trying to setup.</para>

<bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h3"> Setting up MASTER</bridgehead>
<para>The MASTER machine is the back-end server machine.
 Various applications feed SPARQL data into this machine it publishes a set of graphs using RDF Replication.</para>
<para>The MASTER machine should ideally be equipped with multiple redundant disks in <emphasis>RAID-1</emphasis> or  <emphasis>RAID-6</emphasis> mode to minimize the risk that a single bad disk takes down the system.
 From a Virtuoso point of view we will use a combination of online backups combined with checkpoint audit trail to backup the content of the database in a safe way.
 The online backups, the checkpoint audit trail as well as the replication logs can also be copied to secondary storage using the <computeroutput>rsync</computeroutput> command and can be easily scripted as a cron job.</para>

</programlisting><para> Once the MASTER is started using the <computeroutput>bin/virtuoso-start.sh</computeroutput> script we must enable RDF replication before we start add data to the graphs we wish to replicate, so every record is accounted for by the replication process.
 If there is existing data in the graphs to be published, then this data would need to be added to a subscriber manually since the replication process creates a delta set of changes since publishing was enabled.</para>
<para>To enable publishing of the graph we use the <computeroutput>isql</computeroutput> program to connect to the MASTER instance: </para>
<programlisting>$ isql MASTER-IP:1111

-- and run the following commands:

-- enable this instance as a publisher
rdf_repl_start();

-- add graphs to replication list
rdf_repl_graph_ins(&#39;http://test.example.com&#39;);
</programlisting><para> Next we create a backup directory inside the database directory and setup the online backup, again using the <computeroutput>isql</computeroutput> program: </para>
<programlisting>$ cd database
$ mkdir backup
$ isql MASTER_IP:1111

-- and run the following commands:

-- clear any previous context

<para>The SPARE machine is a replica of the MASTER machine.
 This machine subscribes to the publication of the MASTER to keep an exact match of the RDF graphs, but also publishes this data without any initial subscribers.</para>

<bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h3"> Setup FARM-1</bridgehead>
<para>The FARM-1 machine is the first front-end server machine.
 It subscribes to the publication of the MASTER instance to keep up-to-date.</para>
<para>The FARM-1 machine can be run on simpler hardware than the MASTER instance.It does not require the same level of redundancy in terms of hard disks etc, as there are a number of these machines running in parallel each capable of returning results to the proxy.
 If one FARM machine dies, it can simply be taken from the reverse-proxy list, repaired or replaced with a fresh machine before it is added to the list of servers in the reverse proxy.
 As such it does not need to be backed up separately, although we could make a backup of this installation to quickly install the rest of the identical FARM boxes.</para>
