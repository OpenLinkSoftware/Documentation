<docbook><section><title>WikiWikiWeb</title><para><ulink url="WikiWikiWeb">WikiWikiWeb</ulink> is a common name for a class of very simple content management system, invented by Ward Cunningham.
It allows a Web site to be written by its users; anyone can modify any page or create new pages wihout even rudimentary knowledge of HTML.
User edit the content of a page in plain text format, using some very simple formatting rules.
 The server utility called &quot;Wiki engine&quot; parses the text and converts it into well-formed HTML where pages are properly interconnected.
Wiki engine also indexes these pages to make links bidirectional: one can both follow links from a given page and go to pages that refer to the given one.</para>
