<para>Are you encountering poor performance issues with Virtuoso SQL queries? If so, use the <computeroutput>explain</computeroutput> function to troubleshoot this problem.
 The <computeroutput>explain</computeroutput> function compiles individual SQL statements and returns a description of the compilation.
 The description contains insight into join order, sub-query structure, and order of evaluation of predicates, and the splitting of distributed VDB queries across different data sources.
 This information is valuable to the detection of performance bottlenecks.
