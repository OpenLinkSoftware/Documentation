<tt>bif:contains</tt> returns faster, because it uses special full-text indexing to get IDs of objects that contain words mentioned in the query.
 It does not scan the whole table like a Regex-based query.
 The advantage of REGEX is flexibility.
 One may search for specific fragments of words or for special data like protein coding sequences.
 Moreover, <tt>bif:contains</tt> may be used only for variables that are directly bound in object position of triple, not for values of expressions of any other sorts.
