== 0 - Prepare to Install ==

If you are upgrading an existing Virtuoso installation and want to preserve your existing data and configuration files:

# Shut down your Virtuoso instance as normal.%BR%%BR%
# Right-click on the existing <b>Virtuoso.app</b> (exact name may vary), and select <b>Show Package Contents</b>.  %BR%%BR%
# Drill down to <b>Contents</b> --> <b>virtuoso</b> --> <b>database</b>.  %BR%%BR%
# Check the size of the <b><code>virtuoso.trx</code></b> file, found in the <b>database</b> folder alongside the <code>virtuoso.db</code> and <code>virtuoso.ini</code> files.%BR%%BR%
#* If zero bytes, proceed to step 6.%BR%%BR%
#* If larger than zero bytes, start the instance from the command line with the extra argument, "<code>[[http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/databaseadmsrv.html#COMMANDLINE| +checkpoint-only]]</code>", and recheck <code>.trx</code> file size -- expecting zero bytes.%BR%%BR%
#* If larger <code>.trx</code> files persist, [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp| contact Technical Support]].%BR%%BR%
# Make a backup of your existing Virtuoso Database and Configuration files (defaults are <b><code>virtuoso.db</code></b> and <b><code>virtuoso.ini</code></b>) prior to performing the steps that follow. <i><b>Note:</b> Virtuoso's <a href="http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/backup.html#onlinebackups">online backup feature</a>, if enabled, should have already generated a backup-set.</i>%BR%%BR%
# Use the Add/Remove Programs utility to uninstall any previously installed Virtuoso components.  Data and configuration files will be left behind by this process.

== 1 - Download the Virtuoso Installer Program ==

# Download the [[http://opldownload.s3.amazonaws.com/uda%2Fvirtuoso%2F7.2%2Fx86_64-generic-win-64%2Fwavpz2zz.msi#this|Virtuoso 7.2 installer archive (wavpz2zz.msi)]] from the [[http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/download/|download site]]. <i><b>Note:</b> Virtuoso 7.x is 64-bit only, and requires Vista or Windows Server 2003, or later.</i>%BR%%BR%

== 2 - Obtain a License File ==

#* <b>Complete</b> -- installs to the default filesystem location, includes all components
#* <b>Custom</b> -- to install to any filesystem location, and select which components will be installed%BR%%BR%
# Click <b>Next</b>, and if you chose <b>Typical</b> or <b>Complete</b>, skip this and the next step; if you chose <b>Custom</b>, you'll be prompted to choose a destination folder:
%BR%%BR%<a href="%ATTACHURLPATH%/win_destination_folder.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/win_destination_folder.jpg" max-width="600px" /></a>%BR%%BR%

%BR%%BR%<a href="%ATTACHURLPATH%/win_launch_manager.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/win_launch_manager.jpg"  max-width="600px" /></a>%BR%%BR%

== 5 - Start and Administer your Virtuoso Instance ==

# Right-click on the Virtuoso Service Manager icon in the Task Bar, and click on <b><nop>OpenLink Virtuoso Server - Start</b>.
%BR%%BR%<a href="%ATTACHURLPATH%/win_start_service.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/win_start_service.jpg" max-width="600px" /></a>%BR%%BR%

%BR%%BR%<a href="%ATTACHURLPATH%/win_virt_admin.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/win_virt_admin.jpg" max-width="600px" /></a>%BR%%BR%
# Use the Conductor to configure your Virtuoso instance for future use. For example, it is <b><i>strongly</i></b> advised that you change the default passwords for the <b><code>dba</code></b> and <b><code>dav</code></b> super-user accounts (drill down to <b>System Admin</b> --> <b>User Accounts</b>).

== 6 - Optional - Restore your old Data and Configuration Files ==

If you preserved existing data and configuration files at the start of this process, now is the time to bring them back into play.

* If you used Virtuoso's online backup feature, <a href="http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/backup.html#onlinebackups">the documentation</a> will walk you through the restoration process.</i>%BR%%BR%
* If you simply copied the INI and DB files elsewhere, and if they were Virtuoso 7.x files, you can just stop the current Virtuoso instance, and replace the newly created INI and DB with the old ones.  For best results, we do advise that you compare the content of the old INI with the new, and add any new settings from the new to the old, adjust as may be appropriate to your deployment.%BR%%BR%
* If you simply copied the INI and DB files elsewhere, and if they were Virtuoso 6.x or older files, there are [[UpgradingToVOS610| some extra steps that must be taken]].
