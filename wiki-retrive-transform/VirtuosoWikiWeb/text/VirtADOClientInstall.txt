= Installing the Virtuoso Client ADO.NET Provider on Windows =

The Virtuoso Client ADO.NET Provider is part of the Virtuoso Client Connectivity Kit.  If the target Virtuoso Server already exists on the network, the Client Connectivity Kit is all that needs to be installed now.  If you don't yet have such an instance running, start by [[VirtADOClientServInstall|installing the Virtuoso Server]].

 <i><b>Note:</b> The bitness of the Virtuoso Client ADO.NET Provider must match the bitness of the ADO.NET client application(s), and the bitness of the Virtuoso Universal Server must match the bitness of any ODBC Drivers to which it will connect.  The Virtuoso Client ADO.NET Provider need not match the bitness of its target Virtuoso Universal Server(s).  Thus, you may need to install both 32-bit and 64-bit Virtuoso Client components, but will only need one Virtuoso Universal Server installation.</i>
