= Installing the Virtuoso Universal Server and Virtuoso Client ADO.NET Provider on Windows =

If both the ADO.NET Provider client and Virtuoso Server are to be installed on the same Windows machine, then the Virtuoso Universal Server installer can be used as it includes all the Virtuoso client and server components available in a single installer.

 <i><b>Note:</b> The bitness of the Virtuoso Client ADO.NET Provider must match the bitness of the ADO.NET client application(s), and the bitness of the Virtuoso Universal Server must match the bitness of any ODBC Drivers to which it will connect.  The Virtuoso Client ADO.NET Provider need not match the bitness of its target Virtuoso Universal Server(s).  Thus, you may need to install both 32-bit and 64-bit Virtuoso Client components, but will only need one Virtuoso Universal Server installation.</i>

The instructions below presume you're just running the omnibus Server installer; [[VirtADOClientInstall|separate instructions cover installing just the Client Connectivity Kit]].
