= Virtuoso Error Message: {{{Transaction aborted because its log after image size went above the limit}}} =

The Virtuoso Server writes a number of different logs, at a number of different levels, [[http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/dbadm.html|depending on various INI settings]].

The "{{{Transaction aborted because its log after image size went above the limit}}}" error generally indicates that the roll-forward log entry of a transaction has exceeded the size set by <code>[[http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/dbadm.html#ini_Parameters| TransactionAfterImageLimit]]</code>, which defaults to 50Mb.  

To resolve this problem, you can try increasing this setting -- but note that transaction roll-back data takes about twice as much space as roll-forward data. Hence, when a transaction's roll-forward data is 50Mb, the total transient consumption is closer to 150 Mb.
