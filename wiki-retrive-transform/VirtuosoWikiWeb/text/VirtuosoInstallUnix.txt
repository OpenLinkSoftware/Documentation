cd into the installation directory.

{{{
-bash-3.00$ cd /usr/virtuoso
}}}

The installation files ship as an installation shell script, a .tar file, and a license. The installation shell script should be ftp'd in ascii. The tar file and license should be ftp'd in binary, where applicable.
{{{
-bash-3.00$ ls

install.sh     srvez2zz.tar     virtuoso.lic
}}}

Use tar -xvf to extract the contents of the .tar file.
{{{
-bash-3.00$ tar -xvf srvez2zz.tar
}}}

Run the following command to start the installation: sh install.sh

{{{
-bash-3.00$ sh install.sh

}}}

Choose the Virtuoso binary that you want to install. Each binary offers differing levels of runtime hosting support.

{{{
  Please choose which Virtuoso server you wish to install:

  1) Universal Server with iODBC support
  2) Universal Server with iODBC, PHP support
  3) Universal Server with iODBC, Java support
  4) Universal Server with iODBC, Java, PHP support

Virtuoso may ask you to provide the location to a PERL library. Choose the default, if you do not have a specific alternative in mind.

{{{

Suggested file locations: 
./custom/hosting/perl

Please select one of the above locations. Note that the libperl.so must
have been compiled with -Dusemultiplicity; if you are unsure of this, use
the one shipped with Virtuoso (last entry in the list).
Default: ./custom/hosting/perl
}}}

Virtuoso ships with default and demo instances. Each instance requires its own set of distinct TCP ports for SQL and HTTP connectivity. Each instance requires a unique name that it will associate with Zero Configuration. Zero Configuration persists information identifying the local machine name, SQL TCP port, and client driver location which facilitate ease  of connectivity to the SQL engine. These values are stored in Virtuoso configuration file and served up as optoins to users attempting to connect via Virtuoso's client drivers. The instances also require a series of administrative usernames and passwords for SQL engine and <nop>WebDAV administration.
