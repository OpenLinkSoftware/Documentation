=== Determine Your Virtuoso Server's HTTP/WebDAV and SQL Ports 
 
There are at least two means that you may employ to determine the ports used by Virtuoso Universal Server for SQL and HTTP/WebDAV: 

**virtuoso.log ** 

1. Log into the machine that contains your Virtuoso Universal Server. 2. Use a text editor to open the virtuoso.log file that appears in the db sub-directory of your Virtuoso installation. 3. Locate the entries that pertain to the last startup of the Virtuoso Universal Server. 4. Look for entries similar to the following: 

{{{
01:12:07 HTTP/WebDAV server online at 8890 01:12:07 Server online at 1111 (pid 264) 
}}}

 **virtuoso.ini ** 

1. Log into the machine that contains your Virtuoso Universal Server. 2. Use a text editor to open the virtuoso.ini file that appears in the db sub-directory of your Virtuoso installation. 3. Locate the [Parameter] section. 4. Locate the ServerPort parameter. This parameter passes your SQL port. For example: 

{{{
; ; Server parameters ; [Parameters] ServerPort = 1112 
}}}

5. Locate the [HTTPServer] section. 6. Locate the ServerPort parameter. This parameter passes your HTTP/WebDAV port. For example: 

{{{
[HTTPServer] ServerPort = 8890 
}}}
