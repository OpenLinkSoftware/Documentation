=== Automate Virtuoso Startup 
 
Two files, named initd_startup.template and initd_startup_demo.template, are placed in the top level of the Virtuoso installation directory. On systems using SysVinit (most Linux distributions, Solaris) the appropriate one should be copied into /etc/init.d/ and symlinks created in the rcN.d/ directories. Consult the following document: 

[[http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/virtuosoinstallunixpe/|http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/virtuosoinstallunixpe/]] 

Note: The above files weren't included in VOS. There's a certain amount of variety between OSs as to the desired format of the things - eg debian have some LSB considerations (). Therefore, it's may be best to start from your local skeleton file: 
a) make sure the PATH environment variable is set correctly; 

b) start is defined as cd into the directory containing a .ini file describing the instance and run virtuoso-t +wait +c inifile (the latter being optional if file is named "virtuoso.ini"); 

c) stop is defined as either execute `shutdown;' through isql to the relevant port#, or use isql -K, or source the .lck file and kill $VIRT_PID, depending.
