---+ OpenLink Releases Database-Aware Toolkit for AJAX

---++New Open-Source Toolkit simplifies development of Database Independent Rich Internet Applications.

Burlington, MA. Thursday, May 18, 2006 - OpenLink Software, Inc., technology leader in the development and deployment of secure, high-performance universal data-access middleware, announces the immediate availability of the OpenLink AJAX Toolkit, "OAT".

OAT enables development of Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) based on the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) paradigm. The toolkit also includes a database-independent data-access layer called <b>AJAX Database Connectivity,</b> facilitating the creation of database-independent AJAX utilities. Thus, it is now possible for developers and power-users to bind user interface widgets in a browser to XML for Analysis (XMLA), ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET, and OLE DB accessible data sources.

---++Leadership Inspiring an Industry

"Rich Internet Applications has emerged in recent times as a much desired paradigm for application developers at all levels. This desirability will ultimately be challenged without appropriate handling of the oft-overlooked matter of database connectivity. To date, AJAX has quite successfully demonstrated the potential of RIAs, without much clarity on the database connectivity front. That pretty much ends today," said Kingsley Idehen, OpenLink Software's President & CEO.

"As time-tested technology leaders in the database-connectivity middleware space, we took it upon ourselves to equip AJAX with the missing data-access layer. In addition, we have also developed a very sophisticated collection of data-aware UI controls as part of a core AJAX engine to enhance developer productivity. It is now possible for anyone to develop and deploy AJAX-based applications without lock-in at the back-end database, underlying data-access mechanism, or host or client operating system levels, without compromising the basic purity of the RIA paradigm," he added.

---++New Generation Server Architecture for Next Generation of Data Web Solutions

To facilitate rapid development of Rich Internet Applications, the toolkit comprises several parts:

   * User Interface Widgets and Controls
   * Event Management
   * DOM Manipulation (including data binding)
   * Cryptography
   * XML for Analysis (XML/A) for Database Connectivity over HTTP
   * Demonstration applications such as a Visual SQL Query Builder, Data-bound Forms Designer, and Visual Database Designer

---++Browser Support

Designed to be platform- and browser-agnostic, OAT has been tested across current versions of Mozilla, Firefox, Camino, Safari, WebKit, Internet Explorer, and Opera. It should work in any modern AJAX-supporting Web browser.

---++Extensive Industry Standard Support

Industry standards supported by OAT include HTTP, WebDAV, XML, SOAP, and XML for Analysis (XML/A).

---++Database Engine Support

DBMS-agnostic to the core, OAT supports use of any data source that is accessible via an XML/A (Tabular) Data Provider, as well as those accessible by ODBC, JDBC, OLEDB, or ADO.NET Data Providers and Drivers.
