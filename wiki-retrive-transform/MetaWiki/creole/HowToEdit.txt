  How to edit the [[OpenLink|OpenLink]] Public Wiki 

== Background 
 
The [[OpenLink|OpenLink]] wiki system comprises many pages collected together into clusters or "wiki webs", two per project, one of which is canonical documentation from [[OpenLink|OpenLink]] staff, while the other is open for members of the public to edit. The public versions have been seeded with a copy of the canonical documentation to provide a starting structure. 


== Guidelines 
 
We expect you to only edit a page in order to improve its quality, that other viewers might see a more accurate picture of your experience with [[OpenLink|OpenLink]] products. We will be monitoring changes to all wiki clusters, and changes taking a page off-topic will be revoked; if need be, users abusing the wiki system will be removed also. For this purpose, `abuse' includes but is not limited to: denying or attempting to deny other users use of the service; defacing pages; advertising other companies' products; using the site for ad-hominem comments about users, people or organizations. 

You need to be logged-in as an ODS user in order to edit pages. 

**Note ** : users who have already registered with

      UNKNOWN tag:

You are encouraged to use appropriate keywords to link between pages and a handful of external sites (especially [[http://wikipedia.org|Wikipedia]] ) if it helps build a glossary of terms in the text of the pages. Keep each page on-topic; if you start writing in-depth material about something other than the name of the page, create a new page for the purpose and link out to it instead. 


== Wiki Markup Language 
 
The Wiki Webs on this server are all written using the [[http://www.wikicreole.org/|Creole]] wiki markup dialect. Users familiar with Mediawiki or Dokuwiki will find it familiar, albeit not identical. 


== Walk-through editing a page 
 
The [[http://wikis.openlinksw.com/|OpenLink Wiki Server]] is an instance of the [[http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/wiki/main/Main/Ods|OpenLink Data Spaces]] application suite. This suite provides an architecture on top of which web-applications are created and ownership and access rights controlled amongst users. 

Let's say you're browsing through the 
    UNKNOWN TAG [span], call for help
    
      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiUdaWikiWebcluster and you find the page [[../UdaWikiWeb/PreInstallDB2ExpressWin32|Pre-installation requirements for DB2 on Windows 32-bit]] . The two bits to remember here are

      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiUdaWikiWeb(the cluster name) and

      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiPreInstallDB2ExpressWin32, the page-name within that cluster. 

At the bottom of the page you will have an edit-strip menu with links to the corresponding page in the

=== Registering and logging-in 
 
Assuming you have not logged-in before, the first time you click this `edit' link, you'll be taken to a login page as part of the

      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiOpenLinkData Spaces (ODS) system. If you have no username and password, you need to register. At this point, you can use an

      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiOpenLinkusers who have registered with our [[http://download.openlinksw.com/download|download]] or [[https://shop.openlinksw.com|shop]] systems already have an [[OpenID|OpenID]] URL, of the form 
    UNKNOWN TAG [span], call for help
    
      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikihttp://my.openlinksw.com/dataspace/person/username> where username is either your email address or a nickname.
 Otherwise, fill in your username, name, email address and password and agree to the terms of service.The Login link towards the bottom of each page will take you to your ODS profile homepage. Cluster Membership 
In order to edit pages in the cluster, you need to be a member of the wiki instance in question.
 This should now happen by default; however, if not, go to http://edit-wikis.openlinksw.com/ods and click the link to `settings' in the far top-right corner, just beside your name.
 In the resultant table of possible actions, choose "Application Administration".
 From here, you will see a list of wiki clusters, including UdaWikiWeb and UdaWikiWebEdit.
 The UdaWikiWebEdit cluster should have a link to "+Join" which will ask you for confirmation and add you as a member of the instance.
 If you see errors along the lines of `the owner of this wiki instance does not allow you to browse this cluster' then check your membership of the cluster in question.If you have clicked the `edit this page' link at the bottom of a canonical documentation wiki cluster, you will hopefully be taken straight to the edit-view of the page after logging-in.
