<bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h2"> Background </bridgehead>
<para>The <ulink url="OpenLink">OpenLink</ulink> wiki system comprises many pages collected together into clusters or &quot;wiki webs&quot;, two per project, one of which is canonical documentation from <ulink url="OpenLink">OpenLink</ulink> staff, while the other is open for members of the public to edit.
 The public versions have been seeded with a copy of the canonical documentation to provide a starting structure.</para><bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h2"> Guidelines </bridgehead>
<para>We expect you to only edit a page in order to improve its quality, that other viewers might see a more accurate picture of your experience with <ulink url="OpenLink">OpenLink</ulink> products.
 We will be monitoring changes to all wiki clusters, and changes taking a page off-topic will be revoked; if need be, users abusing the wiki system will be removed also.
 For this purpose, `abuse&#39; includes but is not limited to: denying or attempting to deny other users use of the service; defacing pages; advertising other companies&#39; products; using the site for ad-hominem comments about users, people or organizations.</para><para>You need to be logged-in as an ODS user in order to edit pages.</para><para><emphasis>Note</emphasis>: users who have already registered with <span style="color: red">

 Keep each page on-topic; if you start writing in-depth material about something other than the name of the page, create a new page for the purpose and link out to it instead.</para><bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h2"> Wiki Markup Language </bridgehead>
<para>The Wiki Webs on this server are all written using the <ulink url="http://www.wikicreole.org/">Creole</ulink> wiki markup dialect.
 Users familiar with Mediawiki or Dokuwiki will find it familiar, albeit not identical.</para><para> </para><bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h2"> Walk-through editing a page </bridgehead>
<para>The <ulink url="http://wikis.openlinksw.com/">OpenLink Wiki Server</ulink> is an instance of the <ulink url="http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/wiki/main/Main/Ods">OpenLink Data
Spaces</ulink> application suite.
 This suite provides an architecture on top of which web-applications are created and ownership and access rights controlled amongst users.</para><para>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re browsing through the <span style="color: red">
      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiUdaWikiWeb</span> cluster and you find the page <ulink url="../UdaWikiWeb/PreInstallDB2ExpressWin32">Pre-installation requirements for DB2 on Windows 32-bit</ulink>.
 The two bits to remember here are <span style="color: red">
      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiUdaWikiWeb</span> (the cluster name) and <span style="color: red">
      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiPreInstallDB2ExpressWin32</span>, the page-name within that cluster.</para><para>At the bottom of the page you will have an edit-strip menu with links to the corresponding page in the <span style="color: red">
      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiUdaWikiWebEdit</span> cluster and to the edit view directly.</para><bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h3"> Registering and logging-in </bridgehead>
<para>Assuming you have not logged-in before, the first time you click this `edit&#39; link, you&#39;ll be taken to a login page as part of the <span style="color: red">
      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiOpenLink</span> Data Spaces (ODS) system.
 If you have no username and password, you need to register.
 At this point, you can use an <span style="color: red">
      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiOpenID</span> URL to speed the process, providing information about yourself held in an <span style="color: red">
      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiOpenID</span> server.
 Existing <span style="color: red">
      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikiOpenLink</span> users who have registered with our <ulink url="http://download.openlinksw.com/download">download</ulink> or <ulink url="https://shop.openlinksw.com">shop</ulink> systems already have an <ulink url="OpenID">OpenID</ulink> URL, of the form <span style="color: red">
      UNKNOWN tag:
      http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:nowikihttp://my.openlinksw.com/dataspace/person/username&gt; where username is either your email address or a nickname.
 Otherwise, fill in your username, name, email address and password and agree to the terms of service.The Login link towards the bottom of each page will take you to your ODS profile homepage. Cluster Membership 
In order to edit pages in the cluster, you need to be a member of the wiki instance in question.
 This should now happen by default; however, if not, go to http://edit-wikis.openlinksw.com/ods and click the link to `settings&#39; in the far top-right corner, just beside your name.
 In the resultant table of possible actions, choose &quot;Application Administration&quot;.
 From here, you will see a list of wiki clusters, including UdaWikiWeb and UdaWikiWebEdit.
 The UdaWikiWebEdit cluster should have a link to &quot;+Join&quot; which will ask you for confirmation and add you as a member of the instance.
 If you see errors along the lines of `the owner of this wiki instance does not allow you to browse this cluster&#39; then check your membership of the cluster in question.If you have clicked the `edit this page&#39; link at the bottom of a canonical documentation wiki cluster, you will hopefully be taken straight to the edit-view of the page after logging-in.
