*Ensure that the Windows Single-Tier license is placed in your Lite32 sub-directories.  
*If on Unix, ensure that the Single-Tier license is placed in the b/in sub-directory of the [[OpenLink]]  installation. Alternatively, users may pass the full path to licenses to OPL **LICENSE_DIR. This variable may be set using the command line, openlink.sh, openlink.csh, or your .profile. **  
*Multi-Tier users ensure the licence is placed in the bin/ sub-directory of the server component installation.  
*Ensure that ftp transfers are conducted in binary. [[OpenLink]]  's .lic licenses are binary-format files.  
*Windows Single-Tier users should uninstall their software, remove all references to Single-Tier software from the registry, and reinstall, if licensing problems persist. Occasionally, Windows Single-Tier users experience registry corruption, which necessitates the registry wipe and reinstall.  
[[OpenLink]]  consultants have other utilities that may help debugging if you suspect a license-file is corrupt.
