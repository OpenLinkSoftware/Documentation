==When do I need the Ingres native client?==

There are two scenarios in which you would require the Ingres native client. You must install the Ingres client on the same machine as any Ingres Single-Tier driver. Additionally, you must install the Ingres client on the same machine as <nop>OpenLink's Multi-Tier Request Broker and Ingres Database Agent, if the Broker and Ingres Agent do not reside on the same machine as the Ingres database.
