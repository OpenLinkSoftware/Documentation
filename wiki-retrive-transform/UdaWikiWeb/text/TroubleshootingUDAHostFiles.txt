===Hosts File===

The /etc/hosts file is seldom associated with problems. If you suspect Multi-Tier connection problems stem from /etc/hosts, take the following action: 

1. Open the server's /etc/hosts file. 

2. Locate the IP address which is associated with the server.  For example:

{{{
83.211.142.99 openlinux
}}}

3. Exit /etc/hosts.  

4. Obtain the output of ping on the server's hostname. For example:

{{{
$ ping openlinux
64 bytes from 83.211.142.99: icmp_seq=1. time=0. ms
64 bytes from 83.211.142.99: icmp_seq=2. time=0. ms
}}}

5. Compare the IP address in /etc/hosts to the IP address returned by ping. If the addresses do not match, check the networking. If the addresses do match, take the following action:

	a) Use a text editor to open the oplrqb.ini file, which appears in the /bin sub-directory of the <nop>OpenLink server components installation.
	
	b) Locate the [Protocol TCP] section.
	
	c) Pass the IP address to the IPAddress parameter. Remove the semicolon (;). For example:
	
{{{
IPAddress		= 83.211.142.99
}}}
	
	d) Save the changes and exit the file.
	
	e) Restart or reinitialize the Request Broker.
	
	f) Test.
