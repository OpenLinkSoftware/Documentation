===Megathin versus opljdbc drivers===

<nop>OpenLink's megathin JDBC drivers adhere to the "Pure JAVA" standard designated by Sun. Megathin drivers contain no references to external .dll's, and they do not make non-JAVA specific system calls. As a result, megathin drivers can only establish Type 3 JDBC connections. 

<nop>OpenLink's opljdbc drivers make reference to external .dll's. These .dll's allow the opljdbc drivers to establish Type 1, 2, and 3 JDBC connections.
