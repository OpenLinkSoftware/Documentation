== Configuration ==

# To configure an ODBC DSN, run the <nop>OpenLink iODBC Administrator located in the /Applications/iODBC folder:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/SYB_iODBC.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the System DSN tab:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/SYB_System.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the Add button. Then, select the <nop>OpenLink SQL Server Lite Driver from the list of available drivers. Select the Unicode version of the driver **if and only if** you are working with multi-byte character sets, as unnecessary translations can significantly affect ODBC performance:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/SYB_Available.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click Finish.
# The Data Source tab prompts for a DSN name, description, and information that identifies the target Sybase DBMS. 
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/SYB_DSNName.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* ** DSN** - A brief and meaningful title for your Data Source Name
#* ** Description** - An optional description for your Data Source Name 
#* **Server Name** - Use the advanced button to configure this setting
# Use the "Advanced" button to pass parameters that identify your Sybase instance.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/SYB_Advanced.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **<nop>Server Type** - An <nop>OpenLink proprietary parameter that associates the connection with a particular [[TDS version]].
#* **Hostname** - The hostname or IP address on which Sybase listens
#* **Port number** - The TCP port on which Sybase lists
#* **Server Name** - [[HowDoIFindMySybaseInstanceName|Sybase instance name]] 
#* **Mirror Host** - Microsoft SQL Server only
#* **Use strong encryption of data** - Enable SSL encryption of data between driver and database
#* **Use Mars** - Microsoft SQL Server only
#* **Verify Server Certificate** - Verify the Database Server SSL certificate against the one specified in the "CA file" field
#* **CA file** - Specify the location of a Valid SSL Certificate for use during the connection
# Click OK to continue.
# The Connection Tab takes a combination of required and optional parameters required to make a connection to the target database:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/SYB_ConnTab.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **User name** - A valid Sybase user name
#* **Choose a database, charset, language to use with the data source** -
#* **Password** - A valid Sybase password
#* **Database** - The Sybase database
#* **Language** -
#* **Character set** -
#* **Disable character set translation** -
# Click Continue.
# The Options tab enables you to set some standard and Sybase specific parameters.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/SYB_Options.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Row Buffer Size** - This attribute specifies the number of records to be transported over the network in a single network hop. Values can range from 1 to 99.
#* **Hide Login Dialog** - Suppresses the ODBC "Username" and "Password" login dialog boxes when interacting with your ODBC DSN from within an ODBC compliant application.
#* **Read Only connection** - Specifies whether the connection is "Read-only." Make sure the checkbox is unchecked to request a "Read/Write" connection.
#* **TDS packet size** - A value that determines the number of bytes per network packet transferred from the database server to the client. The correct setting of this attribute can improve performance. When set to 0, the initial default, the driver uses the default packet size as specified in the Sybase server configuration. When set to -1, the driver computes the maximum allowable packet size on the first connect to the data source and saves the value in the system information. When set to x, an integer from 1 to 10, which indicates a multiple of 512 bytes (for example, Packet Size of 6 means to set the packet size to 6 * 512 equal 3072 bytes). For you to take advantage of this connection attribute, you must configure the System 10 server for a maximum network packet size greater than or equal to the value you specified for Packet Size.
#* **Prepare Method**- This option is specific to the TDS Driver for Microsoft & Sybase SQL Servers. It can take the values None, Partial Full (connectoptions -O [0, 1, 2] respectively). It is used to determine whether stored procedures are created on the server for calls to SQLPrepare. [[WhatDoesPrepareMethodDo|More]]
#* **No Quoted Identifiers**- This option indicates that the underlying driver does not support quoted identifiers, which is required for Jet engine based products like Microsoft Access.
#* **Use ANSI nulls, padding and warnings**- This option affects TDS agent & Lite Driver connections to Microsoft SQL Server databases. Sybase connectivity is not affected. [[WhatDoesUSEANSINullsPaddingAndWarningsDo|More]]
#* **Map Serializable to Snapshot isolation level** - Microsoft SQL Server only
#* **SQL_DBMS Name** - Manually overrides the <nop>SQLGetInfo(SQL_DBMS_NAME) response returned by the driver. This is required for products like Microsoft <nop>InfoPath for which the return the value should be "SQL Server".
# Click Continue to view additional preferences that can be set for the connection.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/SYB_Preferences.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Initialization SQL** - Lets you specify a file containing SQL statements that will be run automatically against the database upon connection.
#* **Cursor Sensitivity** - Enables or disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library calculates checksums for each row in the current rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already stored in the row version cache for the same rows when fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the row has been updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user's point of view, the only visible difference between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same. Deleted rows don't appear in the rowset. Updates to the row since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in the rowset, if their keys fall within the span of the rowset. If your application does not need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the 'High Cursor Sensitivity' checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the table oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the appropriate script for the target database.
#* **<nop>MaxRows Override** - Allows you to define a limit on the maximum number of rows to be returned from a query. The default value of 0 means no limit
#* **Enable Microsoft Jet Engine options** - 
#* **Disable <nop>autocommit** - Changes the default commit behaviour of the <nop>OpenLink driver. The default mode is <nop>AutoCommit (box unchecked).
#* **Disable rowset size limit** - Removes <nop>OpenLink's default [[100 rowset restriction]]
#* **Defer fetching of long data** - Defers fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data unless explicitly requested in a query. This provides significant performance increases when fields in query do not include LONG data fields.
#* **Multiple Active Statements Emulation** - 
# Click the Finish button to save your new Data Source Name.
