*Unix users need to ensure that openlink.sh (Bourne/Bash) or openlink.csh (C) is executed in the appropriate shell. These shell scripts set environment variables that pertain to ODBC.  
*Unix users need to run set or env to ensure that the environment variables (ODBCINI, ODBCINSTINI, etc.) are actually set.  
*Unix users need to ensure that the appropriate [Environment] section of the ~/openlink/bin/openlink.ini file contains the correct environment variables. For example: 
{{{
[Environment Informix 7.3] INFORMIXDIR = /dbs2/informix/online731 INFORMIXSERVER = openlinux DELIMIDENT = Y OPL_INF_MULTISESS = Y OPL_SPACEPADCHAR = Y CURSOR_SENSITIVITY = LOW ;FORCE_DORMANT = 1 ;FET_BUF_SIZE= 65535 ;FORCE_ONLINE_DATABASE= 1 
}}}
 
*Windows users need to ensure that their System and User PATH variables contain the [[OpenLink]]  driver .dlls and database native client .dlls. (Database native client .dll's are not required for [[MySQL]]  , [[PostgreSQL]]  , SQLServer, or Sybase.)  
*Windows users may need to set other System and User PATH variables depending on the database. For example, Progress users need to set PROGRESSINI and PROMSGS.
