= Error Message: {{{the broker cannot resolve your request}}} =

This error message typically arises when your DSN is misconfigured. To remedy this problem, take the following action:
# Use a text editor to open the {{{oplrqb.ini}}} file which resides in the {{{/bin/}}} sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink server components installation.
# Locate the {{{[Domain Aliases]}}} stanza. For example:
{{{
[Domain Aliases]
Progress 81A = pro81a
Progress 82A = pro82a
}}}
# The Domain keyword of your DSN should be set to one of the left-side values. For example:
{{{
Domain = Progress 82A
}}}
# If none of the existing Aliases is suitable, you can add a new alias to the list, including something custom for your user base, and put that in your DSN. For example:
{{{
[Domain Aliases]
OurProgressDatabase = pro82a
}}}
# There should already exist (or you can create) a properly configured Mapping Rule, Agent Configuration ({{{[generic_...]}}}) stanza, and corresponding {{{Environment}}} stanza, which correspond to the right-side value for the alias in your DSN. For example:
{{{
[Mapping Rules]
pro82a:*:*:*:*:*:* = accept generic_pro82a

...

[generic_pro82a]
Program = pro82a_sv.exe
Environment = PROGRESS82A
ServerOptions = -q -d mdy -TB 31 -TM 31
ReUse = never

...

[Environment PROGRESS82A]
DLC = C:\DLC
Path = C:\DLC\BIN;D:\WINNT\System32
}}}
# If you have made any changes, save the Rulebook, and stop and restart your Broker.
# Test.
