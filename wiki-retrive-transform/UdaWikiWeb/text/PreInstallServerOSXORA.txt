====Pre-Installation Checklist for Request Broker & Oracle  Agents (Mac OS X)====

==== DBMS Requirements ====

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target Oracle DBMS instance and database:

* [[HowDoIFindMyOracleSID|Oracle SID]]
* [[HowDoIFindMyOracleTCPPort|Oracle TCP Port]]
* [[HowDoIFindMySQLNetOrNetServiceName|Oracle SQL*Net or Net Service Name]]*
* Hostname or IP adddress of Oracle database server

* An Oracle SQL*Net alias or Net Service Name is only required when the <nop>OpenLink serve components are not installed on the Oracle server.

==== Software Requirements ====

*  You will need an installation of the DBMS native client on a supported operating system, if you cannot install <nop>OpenLink's Multi-Tier server components on the same machine as Oracle. At the time of writing, this product is called SQL*Net, Net 8, Net 9, and Net 10. Product names may vary over time.

==== Configuration Requirements ====

* <nop>OpenLink's Request Broker and database-specific Agents must be installed on the same machine as Oracle or an Oracle native client. 

* You must know whether the local Oracle or Oracle native client is 32 or 64bit. <nop>OpenLink's Request Broker and Agents must share the bit format of the local Oracle or Oracle native client.

* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are in use on the local OSX machine. These ports are used by OpenLink's Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. You will need to allocate different ports for these two services during installation.
