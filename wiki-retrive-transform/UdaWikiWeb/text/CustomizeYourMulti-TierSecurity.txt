==Customize Your Multi-Tier Security==

The following instructions will enable you to provide greater security for your database: 

# List all Domain aliases (aka "<nop>ServerTypes") used in your client-side DSNs. For example:
{{{
Oracle 8.0.x
}}}
# Use a text editor to open the {{{oplrqb.ini}}} file which resides in the {{{/bin}}} sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink server components installation. 
# Locate {{{[Domain Aliases]}}} and determine how those listed above are resolved. For example:
{{{
[Domain Aliases]
Oracle 8.0.x = ora80
}}}
# Locate the resolved names of the Domain Aliases under {{{[Mapping Rules]}}}. For instance: 
{{{
[Mapping Rules]
ora80:*:*:*:*:*:* = accept generic_ora80. 
}}}
# Determine whether any of these fields need added security. Here is a breakdown: 
{{{
domain_name:database:user:client_os:machine_id:app_name:operation_mode
}}}
(**Note:** "operation_mode" refers to read-only (ro) or read-and-write (rw) access.)
# Build rules to govern whether connection requests will be accepted or rejected by the Broker. For instance: 
{{{
ora80:*:scott:*:*:*:* = reject User "scott" is not allowed to connect to this service.
}}}
This rule rejects all connection attempts made by user scott, and tells them so.  You can substitute any plain-text rejection message here, and it will be delivered to users who are blocked by this rule.
# Order each rule properly.  For example: 
{{{
ora80:*:*:*:*:*:* = accept generic_ora80                     
ora80:*:*:*:*:msaccess:* = reject Microsoft Access is not allowed to connect to this service.        
}}}
The first rule permits access to generic_ora80 in all scenarios. The second rule is never visited, since the preceding rule permits all ora80 requests. 
{{{
ora80:*:*:*:*:msaccess:* = reject Microsoft Access is not allowed to connect to this service.
ora80:*:*:*:*:*:* = accept generic_ora80                     
}}}
The first rule screens for and rejects connections requested by Microsoft Access.  Connections not originating with Microsoft Access are passed on to the second rule, which permits all requests. 
# Save your changes and exit the file.
# Restart your Broker.
