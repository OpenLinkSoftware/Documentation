===Broker Timeout===


Broker Timeout is a Communications parameter, which appears in various places. You may find Broker Timeout in the <nop>OpenLink Client Configuration Utility, Session Rules Book, Administrative Assistant, or udbc.ini file. This parameter represents the maximum number of seconds, which oplshut will wait to establish a connection to the Broker. Finally, the Broker Timeout and Receive Timeout must maintain a certain ratio. The suggested value for Broker Timeout is 30. At most, the Receive Timeout should be half of the Broker Timeout. The optimum value is 10.
