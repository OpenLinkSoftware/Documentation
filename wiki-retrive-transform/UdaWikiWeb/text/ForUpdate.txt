=FOR UPDATE=

<nop>OpenLink Software has not implemented the non-standard "FOR UPDATE" cursor model. However, you can set the connection's transaction isolation level which may sufficiently serve the purpose. To proceed, take the following action:

# Create a new text file.
# Insert the command that your database uses to set its isolation level. For example:
{{{
set isolation to dirty read
}}}
# Save and exit your file.

==If using Multi-Tier drivers==

# Open your Broker Rulebook ({{{oplrqb.ini}}}) in your favorite text editor. The Rulebook is typically found in the {{{/bin}}} sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink server components installation.
# Locate the {{{[generic_xxxx]}}} section, which corresponds to your <nop>OpenLink Database Agent. For example:
{{{
[generic_inf7]
Program = inf7_mv.exe
;CommandLine =
Environment = INFORMIX7
OpsysLogin = Yes
ReUse = always
}}}
# Remove any leading semicolon (;) from <nop>CommandLine.
# Add {{{+initsql isolation_command_filename}}} to the <nop>CommandLine value. For example:
{{{
CommandLine = +initsql /path/to/inf73sv.sql
}}}
# Save your changes and exit the file.
# Reinitialize or restart the Broker.
# Test your connection.
    

==If using Single-Tier drivers==

In the DSN Setup dialog, locate the **Initial SQL** setting, and put the full path to your text file there.

You can also manually edit the relevant DSN in <code>odbc.ini</code> or the Registry, and set the keyword <code><nowiki>InitSQL</nowiki></code> to the same path.
