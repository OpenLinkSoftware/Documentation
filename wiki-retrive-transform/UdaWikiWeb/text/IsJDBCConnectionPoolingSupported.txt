===Is JDBC Connection Pooling Supported?=== 

<nop>OpenLink will introduce support for JDBC connection pooling in the near future. In the interim, the JDBC agents do not provide direct support for this 2.0 extension. Instead, <nop>OpenLink 4.0 provides multi-threading across the client and server tier. This should provide the same speed and functionality associated with JDBC connection pooling. Moreover, all of <nop>OpenLink's Multi-Tier software provides database agent reuse rules. These rules can be set to emulate connection pooling. Contact Product Support, for additional information.
