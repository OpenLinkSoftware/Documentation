===Cannot use database commands in a explicit database connection===

"Cannot use database commands in a explicit database connection" errors are returned by the Informix server if you attempt to perform an Informix server database command in a explicit database connection. Examples of an Informix server database command are:

{{{ 
  DATABASE
      <DBNAME>
      -- changes current database
       CREATE DATABASE <DBNAME> -- creates a new
      database
}}}

Such commands can not be used if you've already explicitly connected to a database. An explicit connection has been made if a specific database has been passed to the DATABASE field of the ODBC DSN.

To implicitly connect to an Informix server (as opposed to a specific database on the server), you need to set the DATABASE field as:

{{{
   @server
}}}

where server is the entry in the sqlhosts file you want to connect to. The sqlhosts file will be located at:

{{{
  $INFORMIXDIR/etc/sqlhosts
}}}

Typically, the sqlhosts file has several lines which reference any number of (remote or local) Informix servers that may be connected to. Each line has this format:

{{{
   #Dbserver Protocol Hostname
      Port 
}}}

For example:

{{{
  iif930 onsoctcp apollo2 1530
}}}

This entry refers to a "iif930" server on the host "apollo2". The "iif930" server is started up in sockets mode, with connections made via TCP Port 1530. (Note: the Port value can also be a reference to an entry in the /etc/services file.) To connect to this server, I would pass "@iif930" to the DATABASE field of the DSN.
