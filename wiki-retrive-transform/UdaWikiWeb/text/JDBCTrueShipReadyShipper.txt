== Windows ==

<nop>ReadyShipper is a 32-bit tool for Windows, even when installed in a 64-bit environment.  

You will need --

* the [[https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp|32-bit Java 8 or later for Windows]] ([[http://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=211997| direct link to offline installer for Version 8 Update 101]]).  Neither the online installer, nor the 64-bit, will deliver what you need.%BR%%BR%
* the 32-bit [[http://uda.openlinksw.com/jdbc-odbc-st/|JDBC Driver for ODBC Data Sources (a/k/a the JDBC-to-ODBC Bridge)]], Release 7.0 or later, which is [[http://download.openlinksw.com/solwiz/view_solution.php?solutions_id=70032&solution_num=3| provided here with a two-week trial license]]%BR%%BR%
* a 32-bit ODBC driver for your target DBMS or other data source

Then proceed with normal [[SingleTierLiteJDBCPreinstallWin32| pre-installation]] and [[SingleTierLiteJDBCInstallWin32| installation]], as documented.

Note that <nop>ReadyShipper internally handles all interactions with our JDBC-to-ODBC Bridge, including constructing the JDBC URL which is typically [[JDBC1ConnectionURLFormat| constructed manually]] -- you only need to point <nop>ReadyShipper at your ODBC DSN, and provide appropriate username and password.

That said, you may want to [[JDBCCompliantApplicationDemos| test our JDBC-to-ODBC Bridge against your ODBC DSN]], without <nop>ReadyShipper in the mix, for which you will need to [[JDBC1ConnectionURLFormat| manually construct that URL]].
