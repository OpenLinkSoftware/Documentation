=Error Message: "Service Error, Please check services and hosts files"=

Sockets-based connections to Progress and <nop>OpenEdge require three options set through case-sensitive flags, e.g.,
{{{
-S prog91c -H prog-host.example.com -N tcp
}}}
This error message indicates that one or more of these is missing or set incorrectly.

* The values passed for the {{{-S}}} and {{{-H}}} flags in the DSN must match those used when the Progress or <nop>OpenEdge server was started.  You can see what these values were in the {{{<dbname>.lg}}} file typically found alongside the {{{<dbname>.db}}} file.
* The value passed for the {{{-S}}} flag must be either a port number or the service name defined in the {{{/etc/services}}} file on the Progress or <nop>OpenEdge host.  If using a service name, the identical definition must also be set in the {{{/etc/services}}} file on the ODBC client host.
* The value passed for the {{{-H}}} flag must be either an IP address, a DNS-resolvable hostname, or a hostname defined and resolvable through the {{{/etc/hosts}}} file.  As with service name, if using a hostname defined in the {{{/etc/hosts}}} file, the same definition must be fonud on both the ODBC client host and the Progress or <nop>OpenEdge host.
* The {{{-N}}} flag should always get the value {{{tcp}}}.
