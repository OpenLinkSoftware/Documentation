 [[OpenLink]]  's 32Bit software runs on 64Bit operating systems. However, [[OpenLink]]  's 32Bit software is designed for use with 32Bit databases. Connectivity is possible to 64Bit databases that ship with 32bit libraries. However, [[OpenLink]]  does not recommend this configuration. 

Please note, if your application is written in 32bit and your database is 64bit, you should always use the 32bit Client and 64bit Server components where available. This is the only instance where cross integration is recommended
