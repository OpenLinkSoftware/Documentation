= Special Considerations when using Visual Studio and/or Microsoft SQL Server as the Data Consumer, on 64-bit Windows =

Irrespective of whether your Microsoft SQL Server instance or Windows environment are 64-bit, SSIS applications are developed with the Visual Studio IDE.  

The Visual Studio IDE, up to and including VS2017, is [[http://www.quora.com/Why-is-Visual-Studio-2015-still-a-32-bit-application| a 32-bit application]] and as a result, for such development **//all//** OLE DB and .NET Providers **//must//** be 32-bit, as must any subsequently interfaced components such as ODBC drivers.

When you deploy your final SSIS package --
* A 64-bit Microsoft SQL Server instance (or non-SSIS VS project compiled as 64-bit) will require a 64-bit OLE DB or .NET Provider and (if applicable) a 64-bit ODBC driver.  
* A 32-bit Microsoft SQL Server instance (or non-SSIS VS project compiled as 32-bit) will require a 32-bit OLE DB or .NET Provider and (if applicable) a 32-bit ODBC driver, regardless of the Windows environment in which it runs.  

Thus, if developing and deploying on the same 64-bit Windows host, you may need to install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of all data access components.

* **Y** indicates the component on the left must be installed.
* **N** indicates it is not required, but it *may* also be installed.
