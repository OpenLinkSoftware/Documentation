%TOC%

   
 [[OpenLink]]  's installation archives follow an eight character naming convention. The first two characters represent the operating system, on which the product was compiled. The third and fourth characters represent the component type, i.e., client, database agent, request broker, Single-Tier driver. The remaining characters specify for which database a product is meant to connect. 

Generic components will contain a series of `x's or `z's in this field.
