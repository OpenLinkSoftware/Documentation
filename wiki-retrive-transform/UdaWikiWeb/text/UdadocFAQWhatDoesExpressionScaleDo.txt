%TOC%

   
This option is a Progress SQL-89/4GL configuration. It provides an accurate value for Precision and Scale when the result is a Numeric Expression. For instance, select 10 + 12 in Progress will return the result as a numeric expression. 

In Progress SQL89/4GL, the Precision and Scale are returned as 0 as default. This means Applications, for example MSAccess, might interpret the results as a string and label it a char column. With these variables, the user has complete control over the Precision and Scale used for expressions. By default, the [[OpenLink]]  drivers will return a default of 15,2 for Precision and scale respectively.
