The Single-Tier ODBC Drivers for MS SQLServer conform to the common architectural perceptions of an ODBC driver -- a single component installed on a desktop, workstation, or application server machine. 

The [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier Drivers for MS SQLServer are a Type B class of driver developed using the MS SQLServer TDS network (wire) protocol interface eliminating the need for the installation of any MS SQLServer specific client networking software. 

The drivers are currently available for MS SQLServer versions 6.5, 7, 2000 and beyond.
