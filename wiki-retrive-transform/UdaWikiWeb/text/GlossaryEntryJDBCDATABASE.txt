===/DATABASE===

/DATABASE is a Type 3 JDBC connection string parameter. It passes the logical name of the database to which you want to connect. 

Example: /DATABASE=sports.db

Do not pass the full path to your database to the /DATABASE parameter. The forward slashes will cause confusion. Instead, pass the full path in your Session Rules Book. To proceed, take the following action:

1. Open your oplrqb.ini file. You will find the file in the /bin sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink server components installation.

2. Locate the [generic_xxxxx] section that corresponds to your <nop>OpenLink database agent. For example:

{{{
[generic_pro82a]
Description   = Default settings for Progress 8.2A agent
Program       = pro82a_sv
Environment   = PROGRESS82A
ServerOptions = -T /tmp -d mdy -TB 31 -TM 31 -q -NL 
Directory     = /tmp
ReUse         = never
;CommandLine    =
;ConnectOptions =
;Database       =
;Userid        =
;Password      =
;ReadOnly       = Yes
}}}

3. Remove the semicolon (;) from Database{{{=}}}.

4. Pass the full path to your database to Database{{{=}}}. For example:

{{{

Database=/usr/lpp/progress/wrk/sports.db

}}}

5. Save your changes and close the file.

6. Restart or reinitialize your Request Broker.

7. Test.
