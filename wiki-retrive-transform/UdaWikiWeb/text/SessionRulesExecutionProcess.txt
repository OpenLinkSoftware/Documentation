==<nop>OpenLink Session Rules Administration & Configuration Guide==

===Session Rules Execution Process===

When an <nop>OpenLink Client makes contact with an <nop>OpenLink Request Broker a series of events occur culminating in the identification and execution of a session rule. The step as follow guide you through this process:

1. Request Broker receives session request from one or more <nop>OpenLink Clients (Drivers for ODBC, UDBC, JDBC, OLE-DB).
   
2. Request Broker parses the session request data stream received from the relevant <nop>OpenLink Client isolating each <nop>OpenLink Connection Attribute type and associated attribute values.
   
3. Request Broker then performs a regular expression search through the rule book looking for Session Aliases that match the parsed <nop>OpenLink Connection Attributes.
   
4. For each <nop>OpenLink Connection Attribute that the Request Broker find a matching Session Alias it determines if the Alias has a non NULL assigned value, if this is true the <nop>OpenLink Connection Attribute values are reassigned to those of the matching Session Alias, otherwise they retain their existing values.
   
5. Request Broker then performs a regular expression search using a combination of all the <nop>OpenLink Connection Attributes across the session rules books "Mapping Rules" template.
   
6. The Request Broker scans through each "Mapping Rule" in ascending order, If it finds a "Mapping Rule" match it then applies the matching rule to the appropriate Client Session request, otherwise it reports an error condition back to the <nop>OpenLink client.
   
7. When a "Mapping Rules" occurs the Request Broker evaluates the "Mapping Rule". This evaluation results in the Acceptance or Rejection of an <nop>OpenLink Client request.
   
8. <nop>OpenLink Client request acceptance results in the <nop>OpenLink Clients session request being associated with an <nop>OpenLink Agent template, this template then applies all of its attribute Attributes to the <nop>OpenLink Agent Configuration process.
   
9. Session Rules rejection results in a user/administrator definable error message being relayed back to the <nop>OpenLink Client.
  
10. <nop>OpenLink Session is fully initialized. This means that the <nop>OpenLink Client and Server (agents) components are now linked and operating in a connected state.
  
11. <nop>OpenLink Agent evaluates subsequent <nop>OpenLink Client session requests to see if they are in line with the <nop>ReUse attribute of its Agent Configuration template.
