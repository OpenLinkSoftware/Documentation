= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Lite Edition (Single-Tier) JDBC Driver for ODBC Data Sources (a/k/a JDBC-to-ODBC Bridge), for Windows = 

== DBMS Requirements ==

* Your target data source must be SQL compliant. 
* You must possess enough knowledge to establish a ODBC connection to this database using third-party or native ODBC drivers. 

== Software Requirements==

* You must possess **third-party or native ODBC drivers** that connect to your target database. A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition JDBC Driver for ODBC Data Sources.
* You must have a **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** that is compatible with <nop>OpenLink software.  
#* Generally, the latest JVM from http://java.com/ is the best choice.
#* If targeting a 64-bit ODBC Driver, you must have the 64-bit JVM, which is only automatically presented to 64-bit web browsers.
#* It is often best to install both 32-bit JVM and 64-bit JVM on 64-bit Windows, but you must take care that the {{{PATH}}} and other environment variables are set correctly (i.e., to load all 32-bit or all 64-bit) for each tool.

== Configuration Requirements==

* The third-party or native ODBC driver must successfully connect to the target database. For best results, at least one System DSN should be defined to make such connections. <nop>OpenLink Product Support can provide minimal assistance in this area.
* You must know the exact name of the DSN(s), or know the complete ODBC Connect String, that connects to the target data source.
