==Installation==

# Login to your Unix or Linux client machine.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Login.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# cd into the installation directory.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_CD_Demos.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# The installation files ship as an installation shell script, a driver {{{.taz}}} archive, and an optional administrator {{{.taz}}} file. All files should be transferred using binary-preserving methods (e.g., {{{FTP}}} in {{{BIN}}} mode) at all times.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_LS_Files.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Run the following command to start the installation: 
{{{
sh install.sh
}}}
# If you have a pre-existing installation running on the machine, you will be presented with the following options:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Install_2.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# You must choose a TCP port on which to run your HTTP-based iODBC Data Sources Administrator. The default is {{{8000}}}. You will need to know this port number and your local machine's IP address or hostname to access your Administrator in a Web browser. This is how you call it:  
{{{
http://machine:portnumber/
}}}
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Install_8000.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Log File? enables you to specify the name and location of your administrator's log file. It is best to go with the default.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Install_log.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# You can choose to log all requests. This is not diagnostic-level ODBC tracing or connection logging. The default is no. 
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Install_Requests.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# You can change the iODBC Data Source Administrator's default username from "admin." This is the name that you will need to log in to the HTTP-based OpenLink ODBC Administrator.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Install_Admin.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# You can change the iODBC Data Source Administrator's default password from "admin."
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Admin_PWD.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# The installation is complete.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Install_End.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%

==Configuration==

# For best results, use the {{{bash}}} command to open a bash shell. Next best is the {{{sh}}} command for the Bourne shell. Other shells may work, but subsequent commands may vary.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/gODBC_ST_Bash.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Set the <nop>OpenLink environment by running the appropriate script for your shell.  The following will work in most environments, but your required command may differ --
| *shell* | *command* |
| <code>sh, bash, zsh</code> and related | <code><nowiki>. ./openlink.sh</nowiki></code> |
| <code>ksh</code> and related | <code><nowiki>source ./openlink.sh</nowiki></code> |
| <code>csh, tcsh</code> and related | <code><nowiki>source ./openlink.csh</nowiki></code> |
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_openlinksh.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Navigate to the {{{bin}}} sub-directory of your driver installation, e.g., 
{{{
cd /opt/openlink/bin/
}}}
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_CD_BIN.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Use the ls command to display your files.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_LS.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Start the HTTP-based OpenLink ODBC Administrator
{{{
./iodbc-admin-httpd.sh start
}}}
%BR%%BR%//Note that if you have installed the Mutli-Tier Client and Server components on the same machine (and location) then the HTTP-based OpenLink ODBC Administrator would not have been installed, as its functionality is included within the HTTP-based Multi-Tier Admin Assistant, installed as part of the [[InstallServerUNIX| Request Broker installation]] of the Server components.//
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Start_Admin.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Open a Web browser on any computer and type the URL for your administrator in the address bar.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Open_Admin.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the Client Components Administration link in the left hand side navigation bar.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Client_Components_Admin.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the Configure ODBC Data Sources link in the left hand side navigation bar.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Config_ODBC.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Login with your Administrator's username and password, if prompted. Both fields default to admin.
# Click the Add button that appears on the first DSN configuration dialog.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Admin_DSN_Tab.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the <nop>OpenLink Generic ODBC Driver (multi-threaded). Then, click Create DSN.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Choose_Driver.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Provide a name and optional description for your DSN. Additionally, pass the hostname or IP address of the machine that contains the <nop>OpenLink Multi-Tier Request Broker (server component) and the port on which the Broker listens. The form is: //ip address:port number//
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Name_DSN.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click Next. 
# Pass the following values in the next dialog:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Connection_Attributes.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Domain**  - The value must match a [Domain Alias], which is contained in the Server's Session Rules Book. This Alias typically represents the name and version of an <nop>OpenLink Agent. That agent version may differ from the DBMS version to which it connects. Note that advanced users may create custom domain names that follow their own, desired conventions.  
#* **Database**  - Takes a database name or Oracle SID. 
#* **DB Connection Options** - This field passes parameters that enable users to connect to <nop>MySQL, <nop>PostgreSQL, <nop>SQLServer, and Sybase databases anywhere on the network. It also passes parameters that enable users to connect to any DBMS that does not reside on the same machine as the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker and Agent. [[MTServerConfigConnectOptions|Review Complete Settings and Usage for Connect Options]]
#* **Connect now to verity that all settings are correct** - Will attempt to connect to the database, once you click Continue. 
#* **Username** - A valid database uid. 
#* **Password** - A valid database password.  
# Click Next.
# The following parameters are optional settings that you may choose to use:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ST_gODBC_Additional_Options.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Secure SSL connection** - If checked, the client sets up a secure connection to the Request Broker.
#* **Read-only connection** - Specifies whether the connection is "Read-only." Make sure the checkbox is unchecked to request a "Read/Write" connection.
#* **Defer fetching of long data** - Defers fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data unless explicitly requested in a query. This provides significant performance increases when fields in query do not include LONG data fields.
#* **Disable interactive login** - Suppresses the ODBC "Username" and "Password" login dialog boxes when interacting with your ODBC DSN from within an ODBC compliant application.
#* **Row buffer size** - This attribute specifies the number of records to be transported over the network in a single network hop. Values can range from 1 to 99.
#* **SQL_DBMS_Name** - Manually overrides the <nop>SQLGetInfo(SQL_DBMS_NAME) response returned by the driver. This is required for products like Microsoft <nop>InfoPath for which the return the value should be "SQL Server".
# Click Next.
# Click the Test Data Source  button to test your new Data Source.
