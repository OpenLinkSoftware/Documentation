= Generating Server-side Multi-Tier Request Broker Trace Logs (All Platforms) =

The following instructions enable you to create a time-stamped, Request Broker Trace:

== Command Line Method (requires brief Broker shutdown) ==

# As a user with full read/write/execute permissions on the server-side Multi-Tier installation, get to a command-line prompt on the Multi-Tier Broker host.
# Navigate to the <code>/bin</code> sub-directory of the Multi-Tier installation (e.g., <code>/opt/openlink/bin/</code>).
# Execute the following commands:
{{{
. ../openlink.sh
./oplshut -fy
./oplrqb -dv
}}}
<i><b>Note:</b> the Broker's output will take over this login session.  Closing this session will terminate the Broker, but you may minimize the window, and use another Terminal/DOS session to execute additional command-line operations.</i>
# Recreate the error condition, by whatever means necessary.
# Return to the above login session, and issue cmd-C to terminate the Broker.
# Relaunch the Broker with your usual launch command, e.g., --
{{{
./oplrqb
}}}
# The <code>oplrqb.log</code> in the <code>/bin</code> sub-directory of your Multi-Tier will contain a very detailed log of recent activity.

== Web-based Admin Assistant (no Broker shutdown required) ==

# Open your Admin Assistant in a Web browser.
# Drill down to <b>Server Components Administration</b> -> <b>Request Broker Administration</b> -> <b>Edit Request Broker's Parameters (Wizard)</b>.
# Enter your Admin Assistant username & password. (Both values default to "**{{{admin}}}**".)
# Advance one screen and set <b>Log Detail</b> to <b>DEBUG.</b>
# Scroll through the screens to end.
# Click <b>Save</b>.
# Click <b>Reinitialize <nop>OpenLink Request Broker.</b>
# Recreate the error condition.
# Retrieve the log and forward it to Product Support.
