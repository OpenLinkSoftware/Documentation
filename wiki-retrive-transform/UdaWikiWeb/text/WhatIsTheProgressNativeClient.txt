==Understanding the Progress native client ==

The Progress native client is a Progress Software product that provides access to Progress databases via the Progress proprietary communications protocol.

The SQL-89 version of this product is called **Progress速 Client Networking,** and may be used for connections to Progress 9.1 and earlier.

The SQL-92 version of this product is called **Progress速 SQL-92 Client Access,** and may be used for connections to Progress 9.1 and later, including <nop>OpenEdge 10.x.

The Progress速 Client Networking or Progress速 SQL-92 Client Access version should match the target Progress server version as closely as possible.  Major-version is the minimum requirement; dot-version is better; letter-version is better still.
