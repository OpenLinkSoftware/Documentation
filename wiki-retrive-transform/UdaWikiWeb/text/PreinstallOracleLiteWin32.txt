= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for Oracle, for Windows =

%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements==

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target Oracle instance and database:

* [[HowDoIFindMyOracleSID|Oracle SID]]
* [[HowDoIFindMyOracleTCPPort|Oracle TCP Port]]
* [[HowDoIFindMySQLNetOrNetServiceName|Oracle SQL*Net or Net Service Name]]
* Hostname or IP adddress of Oracle database server

== Software Requirements ==

* You need to know whether the client application is 32-bit or 64-bit. The Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for Oracle must match the bit format of the client application.
* The Oracle native client on a supported operating system, if you cannot install the Multi-Tier server components on the same machine as Oracle itself. At the time of writing, this product may be called SQL*Net, Net 8, Net 9, Net 10, the Oracle Instant Client, or the OCI Client, depending on the Oracle version. Product names vary over time. 

* You must have Oracle client software installed on the same machine as <nop>OpenLink's Lite drivers. You can obtain the relevant Oracle client from your Oracle installation CDs. You can also download the Oracle client from the Oracle Web site.
#* Historically, this required installation of Oracle's SQL*Net or Net8, Net9, or Net10 software. These are full client packages for various versions of the Oracle DBMS. 
#* As of Release 6.x, when targeting Oracle 8.1.7.4 or later, you only require the Oracle <nop>InstantClient. The Oracle <nop>InstantClient comprises a small set of library files.  
#* The local Oracle client components must match the bit format of the client application and the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for Oracle.
* You must ensure that the Oracle client software successfully connects to the Oracle DBMS.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* There is minimal configuration associated with use of Oracle's <nop>InstantClients. They must appear in the System and User PATH. 
* Oracle's SQL*Net and Net8/9/10+ products require the configuration of an [[ConfigureOracleNetServiceNameWindows|Oracle Net Service Name]].
