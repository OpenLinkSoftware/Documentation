= UDA Error Message: {{{You need to upgrade your license to run this software}}} =

This error is typically seen in two situations --

* when the license is for an earlier version of the software than is being used -- for example, when a Release 5.x license is being used with a Release 6.x driver.

* when the license is for a smaller number of logical processors than the machine reports to our components -- for example, when a 1 (one) CPU license is used on a dual-core machine.

To resolve this error, provide your Account Manager with the number of processor cores in your machine, and indicate whether hyper-threading is active.  Also provide the version(s) of the OpenLink component(s) you're trying to use, and a copy of the current license file. Your Account Manager will provide an appropriate temporary license for testing, and assess whether any additional fees will be due before provision of a new permanent license.

== Evidence ==

* Logical processor and physical processor core counts
* Hyper-Threading status
* Driver version information
* License file
