==When do I need the DB2 native client?==

There are two scenarios in which you would require the DB2 native client. You must install the DB2 client on the same machine as any DB2 Single-Tier driver. Additionally, you must install the DB2 client on the same machine as <nop>OpenLink's Request Broker and DB2 Database Agent, if the Broker and DB2 Agent do not reside on the same machine as the DB2 database.
