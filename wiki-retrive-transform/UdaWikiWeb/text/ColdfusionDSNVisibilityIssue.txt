===How do I get <nop>Coldfusion to see my <nop>OpenLink DSN on *nix?===

In order to get <nop>ColdFusion to recognize the <nop>Openlink driver on Unix/Linux, you need to manually add the appropriate lines from your <nop>OpenLink odbc.ini file (set via $ODBCINI) to the odbc.ini file in <nop>Coldfusion's "odbc" directory.

These lines include the entry from the [ODBC Data Sources] section, and the DSN section itself.  E.g:

{{{
  [ODBC Data Sources]
  accessonwin32 = Openlink Generic ODBC Driver

  [accessonwin32]
  Driver=/usr/openlink/lib/oplodbc.so.1
  Description=Ms Access sample database
  Database=Accessdsn
  ServerType=Odbc
  Host=MYWIN32HOSTMACHINE
  Username=
  ;Password=
}}}

(where "Accessdsn" is the name of your MS Access DSN on Windows.

After you've modified and saved the CF odbc.ini file accordingly, the <nop>Coldfusion ODBC Data Sources Administration screen should reflect the new DSN upon refresh.  You should then be able to verify the DSN and use it in your CFQUERY tags accordingly.
