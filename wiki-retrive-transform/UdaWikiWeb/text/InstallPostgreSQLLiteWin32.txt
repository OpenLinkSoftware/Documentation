== Installation ==

# The **Lite Edition (Single-Tier) ODBC Driver for <nop>PostgreSQL** is distributed in a single <code>.msi</code> file.
# Click the **Open** link that appears in your Downloads dialog.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Postgres_Open.JPG" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# The installer will display a **Welcome** message. Click "Next."
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_Welcome.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# The next screen will display the **License Agreement** for the <nop>OpenLink Lite Driver. Please read and check the "I accept the license agreement" checkbox. Then, click **Next.**
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_Agreement.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# The driver needs a license file to operate. Click the Browse button to locate a commercial or evaluation license that you have previously downloaded onto your local hard drive. Alternatively, click the **Try & Buy** button to obtain a commercial or evaluation license. You can also tick the "I don't want to install a license file right now" check box. This option will permit you to install the product; however, you will not be able to use the product until you obtain a commercial or evaluation license key.

# Click **Next.**
# Choose from the **Typical**, **Complete**, and **Custom** installation types.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_InstallOptions.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click **Next.**
# Click the **Install** button.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_InstallButton.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Installation is complete. Click the **Finish** button.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_Finish.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# You may be prompted to restart your computer, if you have a pre-existing <nop>OpenLink License Manager running on your computer.  This reboot not always necessary, but is generally recommended.

== Configuration ==

# Launch the **ODBC Administrator** [[Win32vs64OdbcAdmin | appropriate to the bitness (32-bit or 64-bit) of your client application and driver]].
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/MTx86_iODBC.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the **System DSN** tab.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_System.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the **Add** button. Then, select the <nop>OpenLink "Lite" Driver for <nop>PostgreSQL from the list of available drivers. //Select the Unicode version of the driver if and only if you are working with multi-byte character sets, as unnecessary translations can significantly affect ODBC performance.//
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_Available.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click **Finish**.
# The first dialog prompts for a **Data Source Name** and optional description.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_DSNName.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click **Next**.
# The second dialog prompts for information that identifies the <nop>PostgreSQL database server and listen port. It also provides a checkbox that allows you to check your basic connection parameters before setting advanced and optional settings.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_ConnectOptions.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Host name** - The hostname or IP address of the server on which <nop>PostgreSQL runs
#* **Port** - The TCP port on which <nop>PostgreSQL listens
#* **Database** - The <nop>PostgreSQL database
#* **No Transactions** - All transactions will be automatically committed. This prevents {{{palloc()}}} failures with out-of-memory errors when doing really big transactions such as exporting 10,000 records from Microsoft Access.
#* **Connect now to verify that all settings are correct** - Will attempt to connect to the database, once you click Continue.
#* **Login ID** - A <nop>PostgreSQL username
#* **Password** - A valid <nop>PostgreSQL database
# Click **Next** to continue.
# The third dialog enables you to set <nop>PostgreSQL specific parameters:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_DBSpecific.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Enable HSODBC (Oracle Heterogeneous Services) fix** - Check this box if you intend to query <nop>PostgreSQL through Oracle HSODBC.
# Click **Next** to continue.
# The fourth dialog enables you to set optional ODBC connection parameters.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_Options.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Read-only connection** &mdash; Specifies whether the connection is "Read-only." Must be unchecked to {{{INSERT}}}, {{{UPDATE}}}, or {{{DELETE}}} records, and to run some Stored Procedures including some built-in functions.
#* **Defer fetching of long data** &mdash; Defers fetching of {{{LONG}}} ({{{BINARY}}}, {{{BLOB}}}, etc.) fields in wildcard queries. This provides significant performance increases when fields in query do not include LONG data fields.
#* **Disable interactive login** &mdash; Suppresses the ODBC "Username" and "Password" login dialog boxes when interacting with your ODBC DSN from within an ODBC compliant application.
#* **Row Buffer Size** &mdash; This attribute specifies the number of records to be delivered from the driver to the client application in a single batch. Values can range from 1 to 999.
#* **Max Rows Override** &mdash; Allows you to set a limit for the maximum number of rows to be returned from a query. The default value of 0 means no limit.
#* **Initial SQL** &mdash; Lets you specify a file containing SQL statements that will be run automatically against the database upon connection.
#* **Dynamic Cursor Sensitivity** &mdash; Enables or disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set **high**, the Cursor Library calculates checksums for each row in the current rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already stored in the row version cache for the same rows when fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the row has been updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to {{{SQL_ROW_UPDATED}}}. The row version cache is then updated with the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user's point of view, the only visible difference between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status flag can never be set to {{{SQL_ROW_UPDATED}}} when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as {{{SQL_ROW_SUCCESS}}}.) In all other respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same. Deleted rows don't appear in the rowset. Updates to the row since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in the rowset, if their keys fall within the span of the rowset. If your application does not need to detect the row status {{{SQL_ROW_UPDATED}}}, you should leave the **High Cursor Sensitivity** checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the table {{{oplrvc}}} must have been created beforehand using the appropriate script for the target database.
#* **Enable logging to the log file** &mdash; Check the checkbox and use the associated textbox to provide the full path to a file in which to log diagnostic information.
# Click **Next** to continue.
# The fifth dialog enables you to set additional parameters to enhance compatibility with applications.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PGR_Compatibility.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Enable Microsoft Jet engine options** &mdash; Facilitates translation of certain data types for the Microsoft Jet Engine. If you notice that money and other datatypes are mishandled with Microsoft or other applications, test with Jet fix enabled. 
#* **Disable <nop>Autocommit** &mdash; Changes the commit behavior of the <nop>OpenLink driver. The default mode is <nop>AutoCommit (box unchecked).
#* **Disable rowset size limit** &mdash; Disables a limitation enforced by the cursor library. This limitation is enforced by default. It prevents the driver from claiming all available memory when a resultset (typically generated by an accidental query) is very large. The limit is not normally reached.
#* **Multiple Active Statements Emulation** &mdash; Enables use of Multiple Active statements in an ODBC application even if the underlying database does not allow this,, by emulation within the driver.
#* **SQL_DBMS Name** &mdash; Manually overrides the {{{SQLGetInfo(SQL_DBMS_NAME)}}} response returned by the driver. This is required for products like Microsoft <nop>InfoPath for which the value should be "**{{{SQL Server}}}**".
# Click **Next** to continue.
# The final dialog enables you to test your Data Source. Click the **Test Data Source** button.
