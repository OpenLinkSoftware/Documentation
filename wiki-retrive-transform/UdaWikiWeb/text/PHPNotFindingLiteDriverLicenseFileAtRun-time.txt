===PHP not finding Lite driver license file at run-time ===

The Single-Tier drivers for Unix (Unix Lite) need to find the .lic file at runtime/connect-time, so to that end the "openlink.sh" script, when run, should set the $PATH appropriately such that installation's "bin" directory is found.  However, since PHP sets its own environment variable at run-time, the $PATH environment variable needs to be set appropriately in the PHP script (via the "putenv" function), e.g.:

{{{
    putenv("PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/odbc/bin");
}}}

In addition, the PHP author should also ensure that the user "nobody" which is the user who typically owns the Apache process, has read and execute privileges on the .lic file
whereever it resides (typically in the <nop>OpenLink 'bin' directory).

If problems persist, helpful information is contained in the HTML output of a "phpinfo()" command, as well as full "ls -al" output on all the relevant <nop>OpenLink installation directories.
