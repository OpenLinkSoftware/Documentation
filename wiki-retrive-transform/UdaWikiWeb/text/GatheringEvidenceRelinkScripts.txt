===Relink Scripts===

<p>The <nopOpenLink Database Agent Relink Scripts are used to recompile Multi-Tier database agents on Unix or Linux platforms. They are found in the <tt>/lib</tt> sub-directory of your server's <nop>OpenLink installation. The filenames begin with <tt>ld</tt>, and end with an abbreviated code which represents the database agent to be relinked. For example: </p>

<blockquote><tt>ldora8</tt> - Oracle 8 Relink Script <br />
<tt>ldpgr95</tt> - Postgres '95 Relink Script </blockquote>

<p>Progress users will also have an <tt>mkdlc8</tt> or <tt>mkdlc9</tt> script. Please submit copies of your relink script(s) to <nop>OpenLink Product Support.</p>
