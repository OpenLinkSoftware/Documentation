*Ensure that the JDBC connection URL connects to the target database.  
*Ensure that [[OpenLink]]  's Single-Tier client components or Multi-Tier server components are installed on the machine that contains the JDBC connection URL.  
*Multi-Tier users ensure that oplrqb and a JDBC Bridge Agent (jdbc13_mv, jdbc14_mv, etc.) appear in the /bin sub-directory of the [[OpenLink]]  server components installation.  
*Multi-Tier users ensure that oplrqb and the JDBC Bridge Agent (jdbc13_mv, jdbc14_mv, etc.) return version and usage information. For example: 
{{{
> jdbc14_mv -? JDBC Database Agent (JDK 1.4)(multi threaded) Version 1.2 as of Thu Sep 04 2003 (Release 5.1 cvsid 00068). Compiled for Linux 2.2.25 (i686-pc-linux-glibc2.1) Copyright (C) OpenLink Software 
}}}
 
*Ensure that you pass the exact JDBC driver name string and JDBC connection URL in your [[OpenLink]]  Data Sources. You can test the driver name string with the java command. It should return version and release information. For example: 
{{{
> java openlink.jdbc3.Driver OpenLink Generic Driver for JDBC(TM) 3.0 Version 04.19 (Release 5.1) 
}}}
 
*Multi-Tier users ensure that JDBC 1.1, JDBC 1.2, JDBC 1.3, or JDBC 1.4 appears in the Domain or Server Type field of the Multi-Tier Data Source Name. (Case and spacing matter!)  
*Unix Single-Tier users ensure that JDBC 1.1, JDBC 1.2, JDBC 1.3, or JDBC 1.4 appears in the Existing Environment field of the Single-Tier Data Source Name. (Case and spacing matter!)
