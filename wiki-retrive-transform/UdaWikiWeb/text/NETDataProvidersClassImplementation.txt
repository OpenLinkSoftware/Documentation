==<nop>OpenLink .NET Data Providers Class Implementation==

This section details the classes exposed by the <nop>OpenLink .NET Data Providers, which users must be familiar with in order to make effective use of the providers.

Many of the <nop>OpenLink Generic Provider classes implement interfaces or inherit from the .NET Framework namespaces System.Data and System.Data.Common. A summary of the classes exposed by the provider is given below.

The table only shows classes or interfaces inherited from System.Data or System.Data.Common. Some of the OpenLink.Data.GenericClient classes implement additional interfaces or inherit from a class belonging to a namespace other than System.Data or System.Data.Common. These details are not shown. For full details refer to the detailed documentation for the appropriate class in OpenLink.Data.GenericClient Namespace.
