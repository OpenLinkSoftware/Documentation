The following steps should resolve the issue.

# Ensure that the full Progress/<nop>OpenEdge DBMS, or the Progress/<nop>OpenEdge SQL-92 Client Access, have been installed on the same host as the active Multi-Tier Database Agent or Single-Tier ODBC Driver.
# Ensure that the following environment variables are set:
#* {{{DLC}}} - (All OS) Should hold the full path to the root of the Progress installation.
#* {{{PROCFG}}} - (All OS) Should hold the full path to the {{{{progress.cfg}}}} file.
#* {{{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}}, {{{SHLIB_PATH}}}, and/or {{{LIBPATH}}} - (Unix-like OS) Should include the {{{$DLC/lib}}} sub-directory.
#* {{{PATH}}} - (All OS) Should include the {{{$DLC/bin}}} sub-directory.
# Re-install the Multi-Tier Database Agent or the Single-Tier ODBC Driver as the user which owns the Progress component installation, if possible.

% cd bin
% ./prs91_sv -?
