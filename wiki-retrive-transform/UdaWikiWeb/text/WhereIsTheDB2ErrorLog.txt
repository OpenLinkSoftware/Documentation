<nop>OpenLink Product Support staff could not find detailed instructions on dumping db2diag.log. The associated db2diag command appears to be limited to filtering, formatting, and subsequently displaying information contained within the files. Various newsgroup posts show DB2 Admins backing up large files onto remote disks and running cat /dev/null > db2diag.log to clear the active log. Hence, there may be no formal way to clear this log. You should contact IBM Product Support for additional information.
