= Error Message: {{{This Client is Not Licensed for Remote Connections}}} =

If you receive "This client is not licensed for remote connections" errors, you are trying to connect to a SQL-89 Progress database which is not licensed for sockets connections.

You have two options --

# You can contact Progress, who can provide licensing that allows TCP/IP client connections, sometimes limited to Progress client processes on the same physical host as the Progress server.%BR%%BR%
# You can also try to make a "shared memory" connection.  Naturally, Progress itself must be running in [[HowCanITellIfProgressIsRunningInSocketsOrSharedMemory|shared memory mode]].  Additionally, the Multi-Tier Database Agent must be an exact match for your Progress database -- i.e., the database agent must match the letter-version of your Progress instance, and further, the agent must have been "linked" against libraries that all match the versions of your local Progress instance.  %BR%%BR%
#* If the Agent doesn't match, //**and**// it is running on a Unix-like OS (Linux, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, etc.), you can [[RelinkMulti-TierDatabaseAgents|relink the Database Agent]].%BR%%BR%
#* If the Database Agent doesn't match and is running on a Windows host, you cannot relink it.  Your best option is to obtain the appropriate client licensing from Progress Software.
