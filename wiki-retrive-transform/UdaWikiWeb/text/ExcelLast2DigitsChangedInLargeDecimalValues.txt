===Last 2 Digits Changed in Large Decimal Values===

When numeric values are retrieved from a database, Windows platforms convert binary-coded decimal notation (BCD) to double-type format. In BCD notation, one byte of information can store two, decimal digits. There is no limitation on the number of bytes which may be stored. However, Windows--and Excel, by extension--can only support double-number format.  This format stores up to eight bytes of information. Therefore, large numeric values are truncated.
