===Call Tracing===

To turn on call tracing and enable logging to a file, use the Registry Editor (regedit or regedt32) to enter a fully qualified file name in the registry entry:

{{{
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\OpenLink Software\OpenLink OLE DB Provider\DebugFile
}}}

To turn off call tracing simply leave this entry blank. A separate log file is opened for each process which uses the provider. Each file opened is named using the file base name specified in the <nop>DebugFile entry above with a three digit process ID suffix.
