[1] The Domain field appears in the ODBC Data Sources Administrator. The value--which you pass to Domain--must match a [Domain Alias], which is contained in the Server's Session Rules Book. Moreover, this Alias typically represents the name and version of an <nop>OpenLink Database Agent. 

Example: {{{ServerType=Sybase 10 }}}

However, you may create custom Domains to suit your needs. Be advised -- Custom Domains must have a corresponding Mapping Rule, [generic_xxx] section, and Environment. 

[2] The Administrative Assistant's Database Agent Settings Wizard contains a Domain name field. If you supply a name to this field, it will override any Domain or Server Type passed by a client.
