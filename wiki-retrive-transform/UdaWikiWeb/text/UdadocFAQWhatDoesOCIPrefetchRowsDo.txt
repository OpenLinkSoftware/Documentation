%TOC%

   
 [[OCIPrefetchMemory]]  and [[OCIPrefetchRows]]  control parameters relating to the Oracle OCI's prefetching facility. However, use of this facility has been disabled in the [[OpenLink]]  agent and Lite driver because of problems experienced with Oracle 8.x and indicator variables. 

To minimize server round trips and maximize performance, the OCI can prefetch result set rows when executing a query. This prefetching operates independently of [[OpenLink]]  's prefetching facility. The OCI prefetching can be customized by setting two attributes, OCI **ATTR_PREFETCH_ROWS and OCI_ATTR_PREFETCH_MEMORY. The [[OCIPrefetchMemory]]  and [[OCIPrefetchRows]]  settings in the [[OpenLink]]  setup dialogs map directly to these OCI attributes. ** 

 [[OCIPrefetchMemory]]  sets the memory allocated for rows to be prefetched. The application then fetches as many rows as will fit into that much memory. 

 [[OCIPrefetchRows]]  sets the number of rows to be prefetched. 

When both of these attributes are set, the OCI prefetches rows up to the [[OCIPrefetchRows]]  limit, or until the [[OCIPrefetchMemory]]  limit is reached, if this is lower.
