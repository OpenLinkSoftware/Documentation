ALERT Users may use [[OpenLink]]  's Generic ODBC drivers to connect to databases, for which no database agents exist. These users simply need an [[OpenLink]]  -supported operating system, which contains 3rd-party drivers that connect to the database. Other users may benefit from Single-Tier or application server configuration Multi-Tier connections, when they have a common database on an uncommon operating system. This latter configuration requires the installation of the database native client on an [[OpenLink]]  -supported O/S.
