===openlink.ini Files===

The Single-Tier openlink.ini file associates database specific environment variables and port settings with Single-Tier domain aliases. For example: 

{{{

[Server Types]
Oracle 8.1.x	=

[Environment Oracle 8.1.x]
ORACLE_HOME		  = /dbs5/oracle9i/64bit/v9.2.0.1.0
ORACLE_SID		  = ora92
;ORACLE_SERVER	          = T
;TWO_TASK		  = P:
;ODBC_CATALOGS		  = Y	  
;MULTIPLEX_LDA	          = 5	  
;OPL_USR_TBLS_FIRST	  = Y	  
SHOW_REMARKS		  = N  
CURSOR_SENSITIVITY        = LOW		  
;OCI_PREFETCH_ROWS	  = 100	;
;OCI_PREFETCH_MEMORY	  = 65535 ;
;NLS_LANG		  = AMERICAN_AMERICA.UTF8 

}}}

Use the following guidelines to interpret openlink.ini files: 
	
# Ascertain which server type (a.k.a. "domain alias") is passed in the Single-Tier Data Source.
# Open the openlink.ini file. 
# Insure that the server type appears in the [Server Type] list. 
# Locate the [Environment] section that is associated with the server type. 
# Insure that the appropriate environment variables are set. 
# Compare the variable settings with the database user .profile to insure accuracy. 
# Use relevant database utilities or configuration files to verify any TCP port settings.
