=<nop>OpenLink License Manager Networking Considerations=

If the License Manager discovers another License Manager is using a license with the same serial number, it will stop allocating licenses and report "<code>License already in use</code>".

If the License Manager cannot communicate with the network, it will do the same.

The <nop>OpenLink License Manager uses the multicast IP address <b><code>224.0.0.24</code></b> on ports <b><code>60001/udp</code></b> and <b><code>60001/tcp</code></b> to send and receive communications with other <nop>OpenLink components including other License Managers.

It is becoming common for operating systems to have a default firewall enabled that blocks all network traffic, such that specific ports must be explicitly opened and/or applications must be explicitly granted communications permission. In such cases, <b>port 60001 must be opened on both TCP and UDP, for both inbound and outbound communications</b>, and/or <code>oplmgr</code> must be granted similar permissions.  If you cannot figure out how to open this port in your local environment, please contact [[http://support.openlinksw.com|OpenLink Software Support]] for assistance.
