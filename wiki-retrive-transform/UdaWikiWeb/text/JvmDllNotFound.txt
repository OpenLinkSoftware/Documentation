= Error Message: {{{This application has failed to start because jvm.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.}}}=

This error indicates that either the Java Virtual Machine (JVM, may be installed as part of the Java Development Kit [JDK] or Java Runtime Environment [JRE]) has not been installed, or the operating system cannot find it.

== JVM (part of JRE or JDK) must be installed ==

You must have a JVM that is compatible with our components

* Generally, the latest JVM from http://java.com/ is the best choice.
* If using the 32-bit ODBC Driver, you **must** have the 32-bit JVM, even on 64-bit Windows.
* If using the 64-bit ODBC Driver, you **must** have the 64-bit JVM, which is automatically presented only to 64-bit IE but may be manually selected for download using any browser.
* It is generally best to **install both 32-bit JVM and 64-bit JVM** on 64-bit Windows.

== Directory containing jvm.dll must be in PATH ==

The path to the directory containing the {{{jvm.dll}}} must be included in your {{{%PATH%}}} Environment Variable. To do this, proceed as follows --
# Use the Windows Explorer's **Search** feature to locate the {{{jvm.dll}}}, and make note of the directory in which it is found.  If more than one is found, work with the most recent.
# **Start** -> **Control Panel** -> **System**
# Click to the **Advanced** tab.
# Click the **Environment Variables** button.
# In the **System variables** pane, locate and select the environment variable named **{{{PATH}}}**.
# Click **Edit** which will bring up a new dialog containing **Variable name** and **Variable value** fields.
# Add the directory path from step #1 to the **back end** of the already present "Variable value" field, taking care not to delete anything that is already present.  Directory paths are separated by a semi-colon ';', so you should usually put a semicolon before the path you're adding.  Typically, the text being added will resemble --
{{{
;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_03\bin\client
}}}
# Finally, click **OK** to accept the changes.
