  ODBC Driver for Ingres 
The [[OpenLink]]  ODBC Driver for Ingres (Express Edition) is a single component installed on a data-consuming machine - depending on the architecture in which the driver is deployed, either a client such as a desktop, a workstation or an application-server machine. No further components need be installed on the deployment machine or database server. 

The [[OpenLink]]  ODBC Driver for Ingres (Express Edition) is a Type-B class of driver enabling seamless connectivity to your database out-of-the-box, thus eliminating the need for the installation of any database-specific client networking software. This driver simplifies the configuration requirements at every attempt, maximizing your data-capability whilst minimising the need for knowledge of the database specifics. 

The [[OpenLink]]  ODBC Driver for Ingres (Express Edition) has been specifically designed for Apple''s Mac Universal platform and implements try-and-buy functionality, greatly simplifying evaluation and enabling a smooth upgrade to a full license, at a low entry-level price.
