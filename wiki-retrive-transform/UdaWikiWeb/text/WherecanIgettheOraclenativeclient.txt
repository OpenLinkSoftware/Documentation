==Obtain the Oracle native client (a.k.a. "Net8", "Net9", "Net10") ==

<nop>OpenLink Software does not supply the Oracle native client. Instead, the Oracle native client should ship with the standard Oracle DBMS install media. At the time of writing, staff notes that the Oracle native client appears on CDs labeled as such. However, packaging and marketing labels are subject to change.

If you do not have the Oracle client install CD,you should visit www.oracle.com to see if the appropriate Oracle client version is available for download.
