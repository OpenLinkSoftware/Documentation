iODBC.org offers free installers and instructions for the open-source iODBC Driver Manager and iODBC SDK. The installers are packaged with source code, header files, make files, and other resources of interest to the development community. These products match [[OpenLink]]  Software's quality and reliability; however, they, and the iODBC.org web site, cater to highly technical individuals who know how to build the iODBC Driver Manager into their own custom solutions. 

 [[OpenLink]]  Software provides commercial quality Data Access Drivers, the Virtuoso Universal Server, diagnostic utilities, and related SDKs. In addition, the iODBC Driver Manager is bundled into the [[OpenLink]]  SDKs and installers for Data Access Drivers and Virtuoso. This software is intended to service businesses and other entities which need a complete, reliable, out-of-the-box solution. 

 [[OpenLink]]  provides value added components in the [[OpenLink]]  iODBC variant of the iODBC SDK. This value takes the form of ready-to-run iODBC ports for all supported platforms, and in the case of Mac OS X this currently includes an AQUA and Frameworks based ODBC Administrator.
