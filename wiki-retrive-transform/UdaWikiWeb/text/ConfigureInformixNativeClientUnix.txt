= Configure the Informix Native Client on Unix-like OS =

Use the following steps to configure the Informix native client to connect to the desired Informix DBMS.

# Log in to the Informix server host as the Informix user.
# Ensure that the Informix environment is properly set.  Minimally, {{{$INFORMIXDIR}}} and {{{$INFORMIXSERVER}}} must be set correctly for the target instance.  The following command --
{{{
env &#x7c; grep INF
}}}
-- should get results similar to these --
{{{
-bash-2.05b$ env &#x7c; grep INF
INFORMIXDIR=/dbs/informix/IDS10
INFORMIXSERVER=opllinux3
-bash-2.05b$ 
}}}
# Execute the following commands exactly as written --
{{{
cd $INFORMIXDIR/etc
grep `echo $INFORMIXSERVER` sqlhosts 
}}}
You should get output like this --
{{{
-bash-2.05b$ cd $INFORMIXDIR/etc
-bash-2.05b$ grep `echo $INFORMIXSERVER` sqlhosts 
opllinux3 onsoctcp 	opllinux3	inf10srv 
-bash-2.05b$ 
}}}
# There are 4 columns in the output.  You'll need information related to each column, though it may not be the value you see there.
#* The first column of the output should be the value seen earlier for {{{$INFORMIXSERVER}}}.
#* The second column shows the connection protocol supported by this {{{$INFORMIXSERVER}}}, e.g., {{{onsoctcp}}}, {{{ontlitcp}}}.  //**NOTE:** If the connection protocol name does not include "tcp," you cannot connect directly to this instance over the network, and you cannot use [[http://uda.openlinksw.com/odbc-informix-st/|our Single-Tier solution]] unless it is being used directly on the Informix server host.  You **can** use [[http://uda.openlinksw.com/odbc-informix-mt/|our Multi-Tier solution]], if you can install some <nop>OpenLink components directly on the Informix server host. //
#* The third column shows the hostname or IP address of the machine on which the Informix server runs.  The hostname used here may be short (infhost) or fully-qualified (infhost.example.com); you need to know the fully-qualified DNS-resolvable hostname or the IP address for the client configuration.  You can use the following commands to learn the needed value(s) --
{{{
hostname
host `hostname`
/sbin/ifconfig
host <ip address from ifconfig>
nslookup <ip address from ifconfig>
}}}
#* The fourth column shows the port name or number for the Informix listener.  If it's a name, you'll need to get the port number from {{{/etc/services}}} --
{{{
grep inf10srv /etc/services
}}}
-- like so --
{{{
-bash-2.05b$ grep inf10srv /etc/services
inf10srv	5678/tcp			# Informix 10 server
-bash-2.05b$ 
}}}
# Log out of the Informix server host, and log in to the Single-Tier client host, again as the Informix user.  If you haven't already downloaded and installed the Informix Client SDK, [[http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/search.jsp?rs=ifxdl|now is the time to do so]].
# Ensure that the Informix environment is properly set.  Minimally, {{{$INFORMIXDIR}}} must be set correctly for the Client SDK, and {{{$INFORMIXSERVER}}} must be set correctly for the target instance.  The following command --
{{{
env &#x7c; grep INF
}}}
-- should get results similar to these --
{{{
-bash-2.05b$ env &#x7c; grep INF
INFORMIXDIR=/dbs/informix/CSDK10
INFORMIXSERVER=opllinux3
-bash-2.05b$ 
}}}
# Edit (or create, if necessary) the {{{$INFORMIXDIR/etc/sqlhosts}}} file and add a line similar to the one you got from the Informix server, along these lines --
{{{
<$INFORMIXSERVER>     <protocol>     <hostname or IP address>     <service name or port number>
}}}
For example --
{{{
informix_tcp     onsoctcp     192.168.123.231     inf10srv
}}}
//**NOTE:** If you use a service name here, you must also add an appropriate line to {{{/etc/services}}}.  For best results, the service name should be the same on both server and client hosts, and it **must** use the same port number.//
{{{
inf10srv	5678/tcp			# remote Informix 10 server
}}}
# Save and exit the file.
