*Ensure that all ftp transfers are conducted in binary transfer mode. [[OpenLink]]  's licenses are binary executables.  
*Obtain Single-Tier client driver versions or Multi-Tier Broker versions. Use ASNPRINT.exe to ensure that the license and product share the same version. (Consultants must open 1.x and 3.x licenses with Notepad. ASNPRINT cannot read these files.)  
*Remove extraneous, [[OpenLink]]  licenses from the machine.  
*Ensure that the [[OpenLink]]  's Windows and Unix licenses are passed by the PATH environment variable. Insure that Unix licenses are passed by the Unix OPL **LICENSE_DIR variable. **  
*Remove references to old, [[OpenLink]]  licenses from the registry, if the problem persists. (Search using license product code.)  
*Please reinstall and register the software, if the problem persists. Windows Single-Tier users should remove references to the Single-Tier driver-from their registries-before re-installation. Users may run regedit from a terminal prompt to access their registries.
