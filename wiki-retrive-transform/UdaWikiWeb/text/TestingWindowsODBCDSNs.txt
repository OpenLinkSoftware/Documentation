= Testing ODBC DSNs on Windows, with C++ Demo =

C++ Demo is a simple ODBC-based Interactive SQL processor written, as may be obvious from its name, in C++. The binary executable may be found at --
{{{
<OPENLINK_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>\samples\odbc
}}}
As with other sample applications we ship, when source code is available, it may be found alongside the executable.

Be sure to launch the tool appropriate to the Driver and DSN you are testing --

|=<b>Driver/DSN</b>  |=<b>Windows</b>  |=<b>default location</b> |
|  64-bit  |  64-bit    | <code>C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\Samples\Odbc\cppdemo.exe</code>  |
|  32-bit  |  64-bit    | <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenLink Software\UDA\Samples\Odbc\cppdemo.exe</code>  |
|  32-bit  |  32-bit    | <code>C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\Samples\Odbc\cppdemo.exe</code>  |
