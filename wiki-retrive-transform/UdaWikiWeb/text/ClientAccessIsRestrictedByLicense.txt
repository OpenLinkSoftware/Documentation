= Error Message: {{{Client access is restricted by license}}} or {{{Client access not licensed}}} =

This error occurs when a client application uses a data access mechanism not covered by the active license, which may be restrict connections to specific data access mechanisms such as ODBC, JDBC, OLE DB, or ADO.NET. 

For example, a Java application connecting through the Enterprise Edition Generic Client JDBC Driver would return this error, if the license active on the targeted Request Broker permits ODBC and/or ADO.NET, but not JDBC.

Licenses may be upgraded to support the desired additional mechanism(s).  [[https://www.openlinksw.com/contact/| Contact your Account Manager or our Sales team]] to make appropriate arrangements for your deployment.
