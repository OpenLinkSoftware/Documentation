===Mixing & Matching Components from Different Versions===

<nop>OpenLink Software does not support mixed-version installations. Mismatched client and server software may not hinder your ability to connect and query. However, version incompatibility issues will arise over time. In fact, if you mix <nop>OpenLink 3.x and <nop>OpenLink 4.x software, you can expect specific problems with stability, transactions, and threading. These problems may only be resolved by upgrading the older component. 


%RED%Be advised:%ENDCOLOR% Under rare circumstances, you may be forced to deploy a mixed installation. As stated previously, 3.x and 4.x components tend to generate problems. However, 4.x client components appear to work well with 5.x server components.
