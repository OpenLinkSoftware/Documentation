There are two methods of tracing ODBC calls. Tracing can be set either by the Driver Manager or by the ODBC Driver. By specifying a Path & Filename in the Logfile option, the ODBC trace generated will be done by ODBC driver. This will inform the support team of what information the Driver is sending to the database. 

Please note you might also be required to provide a Driver Manager trace where applicable.
