==<nop>OpenLink Multi-tier Server Side Components (Unix) for Sybase==

===Aims and Intentions ===

This guide is intended to enable competent system administrators to install and configure <nop>OpenLink Multi-tier client side components on *nix style operating systems in a few steps as possible.

This guide does not explain any of the non-pertinent features encountered along the way. Such explanations may be found in the full documentation.


===Prerequisites===

* You **MUST** be proficient in using a Unix shell.

===Installation===

# Log onto the machine and create a suitable <nop>OpenLink installation directory ($OPENLINK_INSTALL).%BR%
# Copy all relevant components to $OPENLINK_INSTALL.%BR%%BR% As a bare minimum, these will include; the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker, an <nop>OpenLink Database Agent for your respective target database and finally an <nop>OpenLink license file (oplrqb.lic).%BR%
# Install using the "install.sh" shell script --
{{{
 #sh install.sh

}}}
# You should take care to enter correct information when prompted pertaining to ports, passwords, etc and ensure that you note these down for future use.%BR%
# The installation should finish without error.%BR%

===Licensing===

<nop>OpenLink Multi-tier licensing is handled on the server side so you should place the <nop>OpenLink license file (oplrqb.lic) in the $OPENLINK_INSTALL/bin directory.

===Configuration===

Sybase needs no additional configuration.

===Start the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker=== 

# **Starting in foreground debug mode**%BR%It is often best to initially start the Request Broker in (f)oreground (d)ebug in order to diagnose problems--
{{{
 #cd $OPENLINK_INSTALL
 #. ./openlink.sh
 #oplrqb -fd

The <nop>OpenLink Request Broker will continue to run, taking over the session, until &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; is entered which stops the Broker%BR%
# **Starting Normally**
{{{
 #cd $OPENLINK_INSTALL
 #. ./openlink.sh
 #oplrqb

}}}

===Testing===

You are now ready to test the connection which now requires that you read the relevant [[MultiTierQuickStart|quick start guide for client component]]  on the chosen operating system.

===Additional Information===

# Any changes made to $OPENLINK_INSTALL/bin/oplrqb.ini whilst the Request Broker is running will require the Request Broker to be re-initialised --
{{{
 #cd $OPENLINK_INSTALL
 #. ./openlink.sh
 #oplshut +reinit

}}}
# To stop a Request Broker running normally --
{{{
 #cd $OPENLINK_INSTALL
 #. ./openlink.sh
 #oplshut +force

}}}
