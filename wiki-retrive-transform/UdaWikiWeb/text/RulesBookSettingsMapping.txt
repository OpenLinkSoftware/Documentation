= [Mapping Rules] =

This section is used to determine which agent shall handle the incoming request. The mapping rules are checked once all the alias mappings have been performed. Each mapping rule is tried from top to bottom until a match with the current parameters has been found. There is no regular expression or glob handling in the mapping rules. The seven colon-delimited mapping parameters must each match up exactly. There is a special mapping rule of '<code>&#42;</code>' that denotes a "don't care" parameter. Do not confuse this special '<code>&#42;</code>' with the regular expression '<code>&#42;</code>' or the glob '<code>&#42;</code>'. It is not possible to use the '<code>&#42;</code>' with any other text such as '{{{demo*}}}'.

On the right side of the '<code>&#61;</code>' is either an accept statement, or a reject statement. The accept statement has the word '{{{accept}}}' followed by the section name that identifies the agent. A reject statement has the word '{{{reject}}}' followed by a text string that is the error message reported to the client.

This is an example mapping section.

Here is a snippet of the debug output showing how a request is shown to be matched.
