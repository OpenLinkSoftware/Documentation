# Installation is now complete, and you can exit the installer and proceed to configure a DSN:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-17.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%


== Configuration ==

# To configure an ODBC DSN, run the **<nop>OpenLink ODBC Administrator.app** ({{{/Applications/Utlities/}}})
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-19.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the **Add** button:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-20.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Select the Unicode driver variant  **if and only if** you are working with multi-byte character sets, as unnecessary translations can significantly affect ODBC performance:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-21.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Provide a suitable DSN name and optional description for the Data Source:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-22.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# The **Connection** tab takes the minimum parameters required to make a connection to the target database:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-23.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Host** - The hostname of the server on which the target <nop>PostgreSQL instance is running
#* **Port** - The port at which the target <nop>PostgreSQL instance is listening (default 5432) 
#* **Database** - The database name of a valid database on the target <nop>PostgreSQL instance
#* **User name** - A valid <nop>PostgreSQL username
#* The advanced button displays additional, optional parameters that can be configured.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-24.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
|**Attribute Name** |** Description**|  
| **<nop>PrepareThreshold** | Sets the default threshold for enabling server-side prepare.  | 
# Click continue to proceed to the Options tab. This tab contains optional parameters that are not required for basic ODBC connectivity:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-25.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Row Buffer Size** - The number of records to be transported over the network in a single network hop. Values can range from 1 to 99.
#* **Hide Login Dialog** - Suppresses the ODBC "Username" and "Password" login dialog boxes when interacting with your ODBC DSN from within an ODBC compliant application.
#* **Read Only connection** - Specifies whether the connection is "Read-only." Make sure the checkbox is unchecked to request a "Read/Write" connection.
#* **Drop Catalog from Meta calls** - Enable this option to have the catalog name not appear for tables, views, and procedures when requesting database meta-data.
#* **No support of quoted identifier** - If set, the call {{{SQLGetInfo(SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR)}}} will return a space (" "). It can be used if the DBMS doesn't support quoted SQL like select * from "account."
#* **Drop Schema from Meta calls** - Enable this option to have the schema-name not appear for tables, views, and procedures when requesting database meta-data.
#* **SQLStatistics disabled** -  Check this box to have {{{SQLStatistics()}}} return an empty resultset. Use this if the underlying database does not support retrieval of statistics about a table (e.g. what indexes it has).
#*  **No support of search string escape** - If set, the call {{{SQLGetInfo(SQL_LIKE_ESCAPE_CLAUSE)}}} will return a space (" "). It can be used if the DBMS doesn't support SQL escape patterns.
#* **Patch of {{{NULL}}} size of {{{SQL_CHAR}}}** -  If set, this option overrides the size of {{{SQL_CHAR}}} column type returned by the database with the value set in the text box (in bytes). With a default value of 0, the driver uses the size returned by the database.
#* **SQL_DBMS Name** - Manually overrides the {{{SQLGetInfo(SQL_DBMS_NAME)}}} response returned by the driver. This is required for products like Microsoft <nop>InfoPath (for which the return the value should be "{{{SQL Server}}}").
# Click continue to proceed to the Preferences tab. This tab contains optional parameters that are not required for basic ODBC connectivity:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-26.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Initialization SQL** - Lets you specify a file containing SQL statements that will be run automatically against the database upon connection.
#* **Cursor Sensitivity** - Enables or disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library calculates checksums for each row in the current rowset and compares these with the check-sums (if any) already stored in the row version cache for the same rows when fetched previously. If the check-sums differ for a row, the row has been updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to {{{SQL_ROW_UPDATED}}}. The row version cache is then updated with the latest check-sums for the rowset. From the user's point of view, the only visible difference between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status flag can never be set to {{{SQL_ROW_UPDATED}}} when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as {{{SQL_ROW_SUCCESS}}}.) In all other respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same. Deleted rows don't appear in the rowset. Updates to the row since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in the rowset, if their keys fall within the span of the rowset. If your application does not need to detect the row status {{{SQL_ROW_UPDATED}}}, you should leave 'High Cursor Sensitivity' unchecked, as performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the table {{{oplrvc}}} must have been created beforehand using the appropriate script for the target database.
#* **Max Rows Override** - Allows you to define a limit on the maximum number of rows to be returned from a query. The default value of 0 means no limit.
#* **Disable Autocommit** - Changes the default commit behaviour of the <nop>OpenLink driver. The default mode is <nop>AutoCommit (box unchecked).
#* **Disable Rowset Size Limit** - Disables the 100 row limit in the cursor library. This limitation is enforced by default. It is meant to prevent the driver from claiming all available memory in the event that a resultset  generated from an erroneous query is very large. The limit is not normally reached.
#* **Defer fetching of long data** - Defers fetching of {{{LONG}}} ({{{BINARY}}}, {{{BLOB}}}, etc.) data unless explicitly requested in a query. This provides significant performance increases when fields in query do not include LONG data fields.
#* **Multiple Active Statements Emulation** - Enables use of Multiple Active statements in an ODBC application even if the underlying database does not allow this, as it is emulated in the driver.
# Click on the 'Test Data Source' button to make a connection to the database to verify connectivity:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-27.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Enter a valid username and password for the database:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-28.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# A successful connection to the database has been made:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-pgr-29.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
