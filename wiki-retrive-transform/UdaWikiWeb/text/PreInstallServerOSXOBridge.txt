====Pre-Installation Checklist for Request Broker & ODBC to ODBC Bridge Agent Server Agents (Mac OS X)====

==== DBMS Requirements ====

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target ODBC to ODBC Bridge Agent DBMS instance and database:

*  Your target database must be ODBC and SQL compliant.
* You must possess enough knowledge to establish an ODBC connection to this database using third-party or native ODBC drivers.


==== Software Requirements ====

*  You must have 3rd-party ODBC drivers that connect to the  target database. These drivers must be installed on the local Mac OS X machine.

==== Configuration Requirements ====

* <nop>OpenLink's Generic ODBC Bridge agents must be installed on the same machine as third-party ODBC or drivers that connect to the target database.

* You should configure a System DSN using your 3rd-party ODBC drivers.

* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are in use on the local OS X machine. These ports are used by <nop>OpenLink's Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. You will need to allocate different ports for these two services during installation.
