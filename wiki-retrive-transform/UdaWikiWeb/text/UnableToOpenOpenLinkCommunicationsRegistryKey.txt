= Error Message: {{{Unable to Open OpenLink Communications Registry Key}}} =

The <nop>OpenLink Client Configuration Utility ({{{oplcfg32.exe}}}) is a simple utility with specific and limited functionality. It allows users to alter a variety of communications and other settings whose default values are generally optimal. 

If you need to use the utility (if we've instructed you to, for instance), and receive the {{{Unable to Open OpenLink Communications Registry Key}}} message, take the following action:

# Create and test a System DSN. This "initializes" the Registry settings for our components.
# Log in to Windows as an Administrator, and try again.

If the problem persists, you may have a corrupt Registry. To recover, take the following action:

# Start a DOS/CMD session.
# Execute the regedit command.
# Locate the following registry branch:
{{{
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC
}}}
# Delete the {{{OPENLINK.INI}}} branch.
# Exit the Registry Editor.
# Log in to Windows as an Administrator, and reinstall our driver(s).
# Try using the <nop>OpenLink Client Configuration Utility again.
