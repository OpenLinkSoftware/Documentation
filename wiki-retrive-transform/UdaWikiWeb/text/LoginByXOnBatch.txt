= Error Message: {{{Login by <user> on batch. (452)}}} =

"{{{Login by}}} ... {{{on batch}}}" errors are typically associated with filesystem and/or database permissions.

== Resolution ==

In most situations, this will be resolved if you run the Request Broker as the Progress user (i.e., the user as which you log in to start your Progress database).

# Navigate to the Broker installation directory
{{{
cd /usr/openlink
}}}
# Set the environment with the command which corresponds to your Unix shell --
|  *shell*  |  *command*  |
| sh, bash, zsh  | <code>. ./openlink.sh</code>  |
| ksh  | <code>source ./openlink.sh</code>  |
| csh, tcsh  | <code>source ./openlink.csh</code>  |
# Shut down the Request Broker
{{{
% ./oplshut
}}}
# Switch to the {{{progress}}} owner (specific username may vary), or if that does not bring success, the {{{root}}} user
{{{
% su - progress
}}}
# Navigate to the Broker installation directory
{{{
% cd /usr/openlink
}}}
# Set the environment for the progress user session
{{{
% . ./openlink.sh
}}}
# Restart your Request Broker
{{{
% ./oplrqb
}}}
