<nop>OpenLink's Unix components require the following ODBC environment variables to be set:  
 
|**Variable**|**Definition**|
|CLASSPATH|A JAVA client variable that passes the full path to an <nop>OpenLink JDBC .jar file. This variable should appear on all systems that contain <nop>OpenLink JDBC client components.    |
|LD_ LIBRARY_PATH| A generic library path variable that appends the full path to <nop>OpenLink's lib sub-directory. This variable should be set on any non-AIX or non-HP machine that contains Single-Tier or Multi-Tier client or server components.    | 
|LIBPATH| An AIX library path variable that appends the full path to <nop>OpenLink's lib sub-directory. This variable should be set on any AIX machine that contains Single-Tier or Multi-Tier client or server components.   |
|ODBCINI|Passes the full path to ~/openlink/bin/odbc.ini. This variable should be set on any machine that contains Single-Tier or Multi-Tier client components.   |
|ODBCINSTINI|Passes the full path to ~/openlink/bin/odbcinst.ini. This variable should be set on any machine that contains Single-Tier or Multi-Tier client components.   |
|OPENLINKINI |This Single-Tier variable passes the full path to ~/openlink/bin/openlink.ini. This variable should be set on any machine that contains Single-Tier client components.   |
|PATH| Appends the full path to <nop>OpenLink's bin sub-directory. This variable should be set on any machine that contains Single-Tier or Multi-Tier client or server components.   |
|SHLIB_PATH|An HP/UX library path variable that appends the full path to <nop>OpenLink's lib sub-directory. This variable should be set on any HP/UX machine that contains Single-Tier or Multi-Tier client or server components.   | 
 

{{{set}}} output should be checked against {{{ls}}} output for the relevant directories structures. This shows:  
	 
# Which environment variables are set.  
# Which environment variables are missing.  
# Whether or not variable paths are correct.  
# Whether or not permissions prevent access to files or directories.  
 
<nop>OpenLink's drivers also require database specific environment variables. {{{set}}} should be run before Single-Tier client installation or Multi-Tier server component installation. Users must insure that the relevant database native environment variables are set. This enables <nop>OpenLink's installers to detect the settings and write them into Single-Tier openlink.ini or Multi-Tier oplrqb.ini file.
