=No valid license was found=

"No valid license was found" errors tend to arise from one of three scenarios:

# The licensed environment reports more logical processors than the license permits. Licenses must be obtained for the number of logical processors in the deployment host.
# Hyper-threading may cause the environment to report more logical processors than there are physical cores present. Users may choose to disable hyper-threading. Alternatively, users may contact our Sales or Support teams for alternative solutions. 
# The license in place is for a different major release than the components installed on the machine (e.g., Release 6.x components, with a Release 5.x license). Users should contact our Sales team to obtain an appropriate license.

If the above are not the issue --
# Ensure that you have a valid license file.
# Ensure that binary preserving methods were used to transfer the license file(s) from machine to machine.
# Ensure that the <nop>OpenLink-relevant environment variables were set with the appropriate command for your active shell --

# Use 
{{{
echo $OPL_LICENSE_DIR
}}}
to confirm that the <code>OPL_LICENSE_DIR</code> environment variable has been set. //This should be set by the <code>openlink.sh</code> or <code>openlink.csh</code> script above!//  If not, set and export the variable from the commandline. This PATH variable must include the directory that contains your license file. For example:
{{{
export OPL_LICENSE_DIR=/usr/openlink/bin;/etc/oplmgr
}}}
# Ensure that you can establish basic ODBC connections using simple applications like odbctest or iodbctest.
# If using Oracle HSODBC or DG4ODBC --
#* Ensure that the <nop>OpenLink-relevant environment variables were set as part of the Oracle and Listener startup routines.
#* Add the <code>OPL_LICENSE_DIR</code> environment variable to the <code>inithsodbc.ora</code> file, if licensing problems persist. You may also set other environment variables, like <code>ODBCINI</code>or the Single-Tier <code>OPENLINKINI</code>, in <code>inithsodbc.ora</code>, as needed.
