===Client Retry Count===


The Client Retry Count field appears in the Administrative Assistant's Edit Request Broker's Parameters Wizard and Form. This value represents the number of seconds, which elapse between a server-based client's first and second attempt to contact the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker. If the second attempt fails, the client will wait double the Client Retry Count interval. Then, it will try again. Each successive attempt doubles the foregoing number of seconds. 

All attempts stop when the total number of seconds matches the parameter passed by the server's Broker Timeout parameter. 

Note: The oplshut utility is an example of a server-based client. Consult <nop>OpenLink Product Support for a complete list of these clients.
