===+initsql===


You may pass the +initsql option to your Multi-Tier database agents. This option passes the full path to a file, which contains SQL statements. <nop>OpenLink's agents run these statements each time a connection is established. This feature is commonly used to set isolation levels. 

In order to implement +initsql, take the following action:

1. Create a file, which contains your SQL statements. For example:

{{{
$vi file.sql

-Dsrv TXN_ISOLATION, SERIALIZABLE

:wq

}}}

2. Open your <nop>OpenLink Session Rules Book with an editor. 

3. Locate the [generic_xxx] section, which corresponds to the agent that you use. For example:

{{{
[generic_inf7] 
Program     = inf7_mv.exe 
Environment = INFORMIX7 
OpsysLogin  = Yes 
ReUse       = always 
;Directory = c:\temp 
;ConnectOptions = 
;ReadOnly = 
;CommandLine = 
}}}

4. Remove the semicolon, which appears before <nop>CommandLine. 

5. Pass +initsql followed by the full path to your SQL file to <nop>CommandLine. For example:   

{{{
CommandLine = +initsql /usr/openlink/bin/file.sql 
}}}

6. Restart your Broker.
