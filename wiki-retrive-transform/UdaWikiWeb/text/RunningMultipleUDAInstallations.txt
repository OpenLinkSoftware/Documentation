===Running Multiple Versions Simultaneously===

You can run multiple driver versions for comparative and diagnostic purposes. Take the following action to proceed:  %BR%
%BR%
<b>Single-Tier & Express Edition Drivers</b>

1. Shutdown your License Manager, if you have <nop>OpenLink 6.0 drivers installed. 
2. Install your new drivers in a separate directory. 
3. Place your new license files in the /bin sub-directory of the new installation. 
4. Restart your License Manager, if you have <nop>OpenLink 6.0 drivers installed. 


<b>Multi-Tier Drivers</b> 

1. Shutdown your License Manager, if you have <nop>OpenLink 6.0 drivers installed. 
2. Install your new drivers in a separate directory. 
3. Place your new license files in the /bin sub-directory of the new installation. 
4. Restart your License Manager, if you have <nop>OpenLink 6.0 drivers installed. 
5. Use a text editor to open the oplrqb.ini files that appear in the /bin sub-directories of both Multi-Tier server component installations. 
6. Locate the [Protocol TCP] section. For  example: 
	
{{{
	[Protocol TCP] 
	PingWatchdog = No	  
	PingInterval = 600		
	Listen		 = 5000		 
	PortLow		= 5000	  
	PortHigh	  = 5025
	;IPAddress		= 127.0.0.1	
}}}

7. Insure that each Listen port references a different, unused TCP/IP port. (Use <nop>PortLow for <nop>OpenLink 1.x-3.x.)
	
8. Save any changes to the oplrqb.ini files.
	
9. Start your Request Brokers. 


%RED%BE ADVISED:%ENDCOLOR% The above instructions may not bring success in all scenarios. The following issues could present challenges that warrant attention from <nop>OpenLink Product Support: 

1. Differing Windows driver versions may share the same .dll name. This could provide configuration challenges. 

2. Some Windows installers may force you to remove an older installation. 

3. <nop>OpenLink's 1.x and 3.x use UDP ports to broadcast license information. You need to contact Product Support for specialized configuration in this instance.
