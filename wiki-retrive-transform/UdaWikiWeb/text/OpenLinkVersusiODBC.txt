===What's the difference between software from <nop>OpenLink Software and <nop>iODBC.org?===

<blockquote><p><nop>[[http://www.iodbc.org|iODBC.org]] offers free installers and instructions for the open-source <nop>iODBC Driver Manager and iODBC SDK. The installers are packaged with source code, header files, make files, and other resources of interest to the development community. These products match <nop>OpenLink Software's quality and reliability. However, they and the iODBC.org web site cater to highly technical individuals who know how to build the iODBC Driver Manager into their own, custom solutions. </p>
<p><nop>OpenLink Software provides commercial quality Data Access Drivers, the <nop>OpenLink Virtuoso Universal Server, diagnostic utilities, and related SDKs.  In addition, ready-to-run iODBC Driver Manager ports are bundled into the <nop>OpenLink SDKs and installers for Data Access Drivers and <nop>OpenLink Virtuoso. This software is intended to service businesses and other entities that need a complete, reliable, out-of-the-box solution. Other value added components include <nop>OpenLink's Mac OS X AQUA- and Frameworks-based ODBC Administrator.</p></blockquote>
