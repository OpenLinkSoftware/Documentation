=Error message: {{{Ambiguous column (<column_name>). (-324)}}}===

If you encounter the Informix-specific "Ambiguous column" errors, take the following action:

# Make sure the problem query executes successfully in the Informix native {{{dbaccess}}} program.
# Place backslashes in front of any underscores that appear in the query, to escape those underscores.
# Use pass-through queries with fully qualified field names when Microsoft Access is involved.
# If using Multi-Tier, make the following change to the Broker Rulebook and test:
## Log in to the computer that hosts your <nop>OpenLink server components.
## Open the active Rulebook (e.g., {{{oplrqb.ini}}}) in a text editor.
## Locate the relevant {{{[Environment ___]}}} section that corresponds to the acgtive database agent, e.g., {{{[Environment INFORMIX2000]}}}.
## Set the following parameter: {{{DELIMIDENT = Y}}}
## Save your changes and exit the file.
## Restart your Request Broker.

Other known possible causes of this problem include the use of ADO or Microsoft Access '97.
