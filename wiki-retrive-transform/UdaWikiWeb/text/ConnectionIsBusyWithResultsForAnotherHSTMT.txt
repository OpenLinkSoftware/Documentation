=<code>Connection is busy with results for another hstmt</code>=

This error is generally resolved by enabling **Multiple Active Statements Emulation**, also known as **MASE**, in your data source configuration.  This uses the <nop>OpenLink Cursor Library to emulate multiple statement execution, with a small performance penalty.

* GUI-based ODBC DSN Setup should have an obvious checkbox for this on all platforms, or you may manually add the following line to DSN definitions in <code>$ODBCINI</code> --
{{{
MultipleActiveStmtsEmul = Y
}}}
* DSNless connect strings may use either of the following --
{{{
MASE = Y
MultipleActiveStmtsEmul = Y
}}}



If connecting to **Microsoft SQL Server 2005 or later,** you may prefer to use its built-in [[ConfigureSQLMARS|Multiple Active Result Sets]] feature, which does not carry the performance penalty of MASE.
