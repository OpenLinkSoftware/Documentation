= Pre-Installation Requirements for Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for <nop>JDBC Data Sources (a/k/a ODBC-to-JDBC Bridge), for Mac OS X =

== DBMS Requirements ==

* Your target data source must be SQL compliant. 

* You must possess enough knowledge to establish a JDBC connection to this database using third-party or native JDBC drivers. 

==Software Requirements ==

* You must possess **third-party or native JDBC drivers** that connect to your target database. A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for JDBC Data Sources.

* The JDBC driver jar file (or a symbolic link to it) must be installed in the **{{{/Library/Java/Extensions/}}}** directory which serves as Mac OS X's default {{{CLASSPATH}}}. Supporting libraries (or links to them) may also need to be installed in this directory, or in one of Mac OS X's default shared library directories (e.g., {{{/usr/local/lib/}}}, {{{/usr/lib/}}}, etc.).

* You must have a **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** that is compatible with our components.
#* The JRE was part of the default Mac OS X installation, for Cheetah (10.0) through Snow Leopard (10.6).
#* As of Lion (10.7), you may need to manually choose to add Java, but the OS should prompt you to do so when you try to use Java components.
#* All Java software shipped by Apple and installed as part of Mac OS X is compatible.
#* All Java software [[http://java.com/|obtainable from Oracle]] for Lion (10.7) and later is compatible.

* <i><b>Important note for Snow Leopard (10.6), Leopard (10.5), and Tiger (10.4) users:</b></i> <nop>PowerPC-based applications on Intel-based Macs cannot connect through our "Lite" Edition ODBC-to-JDBC Bridge, due to limitations in Mac OS X and its JRE.  Commonly problematic applications include Microsoft Query as shipped with Microsoft Office:Mac v.X through Microsoft Office:Mac 2011 (upon which Microsoft Excel 2011 and earlier depend), and FileMaker Pro v8 and earlier.
#* <nop>PowerPC-native applications on <nop>PowerPC-based Macs can connect through our "Lite" Edition ODBC-to-JDBC Bridge.
#* Intel-native applications, and Universal Binary applications which include Intel-native components, on Intel-based Macs can connect through our "Lite" Edition ODBC-to-JDBC Bridge.
#* <nop>PowerPC-based applications on Intel-based Macs can connect through our [[http://uda.openlinksw.com/odbc-jdbc-mt/| Multi-Tier "Enterprise" Edition]] JDBC Bridge solution.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* You must be able to connect to the target database using the JDBC driver. <nop>OpenLink Product Support can provide minimal assistance in this area.

* You must know the **driver class name** of the JDBC driver.

* You must know the full details of the **JDBC connection URL** that connects to your target database.
