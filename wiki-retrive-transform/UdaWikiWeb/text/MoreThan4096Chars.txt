You may receive this message when issuing long SQL statements to a Progress instance.

The <code>-inp</code> parameter is a Progress startup parameter, and must usually be set when the Progress server is started, typically through the "<code>startup.pf</code>" file, which is itself typically (but not always) found in the <code>$DLC</code> directory.  The active file may also be specified by the <code>$PROSTARTUP</code> environment variable.

When <code>-inp</code> is increased, you generally must also increase <code>-tok</code>, and the latter is generally recommended to be set to its maximum.  For example, the following lines would be added to your <code>startup.pf</code> &mdash;
{{{
-inp 8192     # max value is 32000
-tok 1600     # max value is  1600
}}}
The Progress server(s) must be restarted after making this change.
