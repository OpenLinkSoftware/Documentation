===Database Agent Version Strings===

Database Agent Version Strings produce the following information:

* **Agent Name** - Is the named agent compatible with the DBMS?
* **Version Information** - Is the agent current? Is the agent version associated with specific limitations, formal bugzillas, or other known problems?
* **Compilation Platform** - Compare the compilation platform information with the output of {{{uname -a}}} on the affected server. Is the agent compatible with that operating system?

Finally, version string errors provide useful, diagnostic information. Failure to produce version strings often stems from one of three problems:

* The agent does not exist on the system.
* Permissions prohibit the execution of the agent.
* The agent has library issues. Typically, the agent requires the addition of the database lib sub-directory to {{{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}}, {{{LIBPATH}}} (AIX), or {{{SHLIB_PATH}}} (HP/UX). 

Note: Database Agent Version Strings should be compared to Request Broker Version Strings and Client Version Strings to insure compatibility. Compatibility and stability problems arise, when Multi-Tier component versions differ.
