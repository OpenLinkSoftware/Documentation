<p>&quot;Registration&quot; errors typically occur if you do not have a valid license file for our Single-Tier drivers.</p><p>If you have a properly installed license file and you continue to experience registration errors, the license key may not be valid for this driver.
 Please <a href="http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp" class="absuri">create a Support Case</a>, and forward a copy of the license file, along with your driver version details, in response to the Case Acknowledgement email.</p><p>If you are certain that the license file is correct, you may have a corrupt Registry.
 For best results in such cases, you should uninstall the Single-Tier driver, remove any remaining references to the driver from your Registry, and then reinstall.
 Subsequent attempts to register and use the Single-Tier driver should succeed.</p><h2><a name="Evidence"></a> Evidence </h2>
