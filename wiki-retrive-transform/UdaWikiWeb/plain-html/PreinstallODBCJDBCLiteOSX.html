<h2><a name="DBMS Requirements"></a> DBMS Requirements </h2>
<ul><li> Your target data source must be SQL compliant.</li>
</ul><ul><li> You must possess enough knowledge to establish a JDBC connection to this database using third-party or native JDBC drivers.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="Software Requirements"></a>Software Requirements </h2>
<ul><li> You must possess <strong>third-party or native JDBC drivers</strong> that connect to your target database.
 A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as the Single-Tier &quot;Lite&quot; Edition ODBC Driver for JDBC Data Sources.</li>
</ul><ul><li> The JDBC driver jar file (or a symbolic link to it) must be installed in the <strong><tt>/Library/Java/Extensions/</tt></strong> directory which serves as Mac OS X&#39;s default <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>.
 Supporting libraries (or links to them) may also need to be installed in this directory, or in one of Mac OS X&#39;s default shared library directories (e.g., <tt>/usr/local/lib/</tt>, <tt>/usr/lib/</tt>, etc.).</li>
</ul><ul><li> You must have a <strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</strong> that is compatible with our components.
<br><ul><li> The JRE was part of the default Mac OS X installation, for Cheetah (10.0) through Snow Leopard (10.6).
<br></li>
<li> As of Lion (10.7), you may need to manually choose to add Java, but the OS should prompt you to do so when you try to use Java components.
<br></li>
<li> All Java software shipped by Apple and installed as part of Mac OS X is compatible.
<br></li>
<li> All Java software <a href="http://java.com/" class="absuri">obtainable from Oracle</a> for Lion (10.7) and later is compatible.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><ul><li> <i><b>Important note for Snow Leopard (10.6), Leopard (10.5), and Tiger (10.4) users:</b></i> <nop></nop>PowerPC-based applications on Intel-based Macs cannot connect through our &quot;Lite&quot; Edition ODBC-to-JDBC Bridge, due to limitations in Mac OS X and its JRE.
 Commonly problematic applications include Microsoft Query as shipped with Microsoft Office:Mac v.X through Microsoft Office:Mac 2011 (upon which Microsoft Excel 2011 and earlier depend), and FileMaker<a href="http://wikis.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/UdaWikiWeb/FileMaker&parent=PreinstallODBCJDBCLiteOSX" class="wikiword">?</a> Pro v8 and earlier.
<br><ul><li> <nop></nop>PowerPC-native applications on <nop></nop>PowerPC-based Macs can connect through our &quot;Lite&quot; Edition ODBC-to-JDBC Bridge.
<br></li>
<li> Intel-native applications, and Universal Binary applications which include Intel-native components, on Intel-based Macs can connect through our &quot;Lite&quot; Edition ODBC-to-JDBC Bridge.

</ul><h2><a name="Configuration Requirements"></a> Configuration Requirements </h2>
<ul><li> You must be able to connect to the target database using the JDBC driver.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink Product Support can provide minimal assistance in this area.</li>
</ul><ul><li> You must know the <strong>driver class name</strong> of the JDBC driver.</li>
</ul><ul><li> You must know the full details of the <strong>JDBC connection URL</strong> that connects to your target database.</li>
