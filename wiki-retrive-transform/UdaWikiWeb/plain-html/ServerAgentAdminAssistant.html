<p>Every database engine has a one or more key values that need to be set in order for database clients to be able to communicate with database servers.
 These values take the form of host operating system environment variables, database connection string formats/parameters, or a combination of both.</p><p>Configuring your <nop></nop>OpenLink database agent is all about creating session initialization templates in the Sessions Rules Book which map key database client values with <nop></nop>OpenLink Agent Template Attributes.<nop></nop></p><p>OpenLink provides a user friendly utility for configuring your database agents, namely the <nop></nop>OpenLink Admin Assistant.
 Another option is to edit the rule book manually, but the availability of the utility makes this a less recommended option, certainly one for experienced <nop></nop>OpenLink users only.</p><p>The preferred and much more flexible way of configuring your database agents is through the <nop></nop>OpenLink Admin Assistant.
