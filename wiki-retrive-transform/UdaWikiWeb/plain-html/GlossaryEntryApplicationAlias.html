<i>Application Aliases</i> may be found in the [Application Aliases] section of the <nop></nop>OpenLink Session Rules Book.
 You will also find <i>Application Aliases</i> in the Edit Client Application Aliases portion of the Administrative Assistant.
 The standard Application Alias is an abbreviation for the application initiating the connection.
 For instance, C++ Demo 
<p> cpp.
 However, you may create regular expressions, which map many applications onto one alias.
 For instance, the following expression groups Office applications together: <br></p><p> <br><br></p><pre>MSACCESS|EXCEL|MSQRY32 = msoffice 
</pre><p> <br>This allows you to create a single Mapping Rule, which applies in a variety of cases.
 If you do not employ regular expressions, you will need to create one Mapping Rule per application.
