<p>Use the following guidelines:</p><ol><li> Insure that you have applied all, current operating system patches.
<br></li>
<li> Determine whether or not the DBMS requires a specific patch level.
<br></li>
<li> Ascertain whether specific patches are associated with issues that you have encountered.
 Depending upon the circumstances, either the presence or absence of patches can cause problems.
<br></li>
<li> Compare your patch level to the <nop></nop>OpenLink build server patch level.
 Discrepancies between patch levels may contribute to compatibility and stability problems.
 Depending on the circumstances, either you or <nop></nop>OpenLink may need to update a machine to a higher patch level.
<br></li>
