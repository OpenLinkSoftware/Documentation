<p><nop></nop>InstallShield makes it possible</p>

<h3><a name="Issue:"></a>Issue:</h3> <br><p>Any application can easily be made into an unattended and silent installation if it&#39;s setup install program is based on &#39;<nop></nop>InstallShield&#39;.
 <nop></nop>InstallShield is an industry standard installation packaging system for initially installing many programs.</p>
<p>To do this you would use a built in function of &lt;nopInstallshield which allows you to create an answer file (ISS).
 This file would be create by walking through a real installation on a test PC and literally remembering all the selections you make as you go through the install.
 These settings would then be saved to an answer file (<code>setup.iss</code>) which is created by default in the WINNT or Windows directory.</p>
<p>You can then re-execute the setup.exe installation by simply pointing to the setup.iss answer file as an option.
 <nop></nop>InstallShield will silently walk through the installation using all of your saved options and settings.</p>
<p>It is also possible to perform a silent uninstall using a similar trick.</p>
<p>Use the following command line options to accomplish this task.</p>
<p> <br></p><h3><a name="Resolution:"></a>Resolution:</h3> <br><p>Install shield options</p><blockquote><p><code>setup.exe -r</code>     will create answer file</p>
<p><code>setup.exe -s -a /s /f1setup.iss</code>     will execute the silent install</p>
<p><code>setup.iss</code> will be created in the Winnt directory</p><p></p>
<h3><a name="To Uninstall"></a>To Uninstall</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <br><blockquote><code>&quot;C:\WINDOWS\ISUNINST.EXE&quot; -y -a -m -f &quot;C:\Program Files\Path To\DeIsL1.isu&quot;</code></blockquote>
<p>You will need to adjust the path of the ISU file for your particular application.</p> <br>
