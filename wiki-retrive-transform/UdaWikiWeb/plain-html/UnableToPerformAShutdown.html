<p> <br>Take the following action to rectify this problem.</p><ol><li> Open your server&#39;s <tt>oplrqb.ini</tt> file in a text editor (vi, emacs, TextEdit.app, BBEdit.app, Notepad.exe, Wordpad.exe, etc.).
<br></li>
<li> Locate the <tt>[Request Broker]</tt> section.
<br></li>
<li> Locate the <tt>HostNameResolver</tt> parameter.
<br></li>
<li> Ensure that there are no semicolons in front of <tt>HostNameResolver</tt>.
<br></li>
<li> Set <tt>HostNameResolver=No</tt> to match exclusively by IP address.
 If <tt>HostNameResolver=Yes</tt>, DNS lookups will be used, but these may simply echo the IP address, or any of several hostnsmes (e.g., <tt>arthur</tt>, <tt>arthur.example.com</tt>, <tt>192.168.123.234</tt>, others).
<br><br><pre><br>[Request Broker]
BinaryDirectory = c:\openlink\openlink software\uda\multi-tier\v5.0\bin
CommandLine = -dv
Protocols = tcp
;MaxAgents = 0
;MaxConnections = 0
HostNameResolver = No
</pre><br></li>
<li> Locate the <tt>[Security]</tt> section.
<br></li>
<li> Ensure that both <tt>ShutdownBy</tt> and <tt>ShutdownFrom</tt> are set, and that there are no leading semicolons (&quot;<tt>;</tt>&quot;) or hashes (&quot;<tt>#</tt>&quot;) on these lines.
<br></li>
<li> Ensure that the user issuing the shutdown command (e.g., <tt>george</tt>) is included in the <tt>ShutdownBy</tt> value.
 Ensure that the IP address and all likely DNS lookup results for the machine they&#39;re using (e.g., <tt>arthur</tt>, <tt>arthur.example.com</tt>, <tt>192.168.123.234</tt>), are included in the <tt>ShutdownFrom</tt> value.
 Note that regex is active on these values, so you must escape the dot-separators in IP addresses and host names; you may need to escape other characters, depending on your host- and user-names.
<br><ul><li> In this example, users <tt>root</tt> and <tt>george</tt> can issue Startup and Shutdown commands, from the Broker host itself, or from the listed remote host -- <br><br><pre><br>[Security]
StartupBy = root, george
ShutdownBy = root, george
ShutdownFrom = arthur, arthur\.example\.com, 192\.168\.123\.234, localhost, 127\.0\.0\.1
</pre><br></li>
<li> You may wish to test with these set to wildcard values, but note that this is a potential security issue which can open a Denial Of Service vulnerability, especially in the <tt>ShutdownFrom</tt> setting.
<br><br><pre><br>[Security]
StartupBy = *, .*
ShutdownBy = *, .*
ShutdownFrom = *, .*
</pre><br></li>
</ul></li>
<li> Save your changes.
<br></li>
<li> Force-quit the Request Broker, using the Process Manager on Windows, <tt>kill</tt> command on Unix, or similar techniques.
 Confirm that the process has been terminated before proceeding.
<br></li>
<li> Launch your Request Broker.
<br></li>
<li> Test a friendly Broker shutdown, using <tt>oplshut</tt>, the Services control panel on Windows, etc.</li>
