<nop></nop><p>OpenLink&#39;s software is not generally backward compatible and is not expected to work with the older database.</p><p><em><strong>Of special note:</strong> Progress databases and <nop></nop>OpenLink components for Progress are compatible, as long as both products share the same major number.
 For instance, the Database Agent for Progress 8.2A will also connect to Progress 8.1A and 8.3E instances.
 However, components built for use with Progress 8 will not work with Progress 7.</em> <br></p></div></body></html>
