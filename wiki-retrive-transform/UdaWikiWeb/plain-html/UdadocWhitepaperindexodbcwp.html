 These include Desktop Productivity Tools such as Spreadsheets, Word Processors, J2EE applications, Client &amp; Application Server Application Development Environments, Web based Database Publishing Tools and Computer Telephony Integration packages are just a few of the many products that can take advantage of our standards compliance.</p><p>For several years, a working party called the SQL-Access Group (SAG), consisting of interested hardware and software vendors , worked towards defining a common database access method to simplify Client-Server computing.
 Microsoft has taken a core set of SAG&#39;&#39;s output and developed a call-level interface called the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) Application Programming Interface.</p><p>ODBC defines a low-level set of calls which allow client applications and servers applications to exchange instructions and share data without needing to know anything about each other.
 It applies to any Client-Server operation, whether or not the client and server applications are resident on the same machine, or on different PC&#39;&#39;s, or even if the server is on a remote machine running a different operating system.</p><p>The Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) interface allows applications to access data from database management systems (DBMS).</p><p>The interface permits maximum interoperability - a single application can access diverse back-end database management systems.
 An application developer can develop, compile, and ship an application without targeting a specific DBMS product.
 Users can then add modules called database drivers that link the application to their choice of database management systems.</p><p>The ODBC interface defines the following:</p><ul><li>A library of ODBC function calls that allow an application to connect to a DBMS, execute SQL statements, and retrieve results.
<br></li>
<li>A standard way to connect and log on to a DBMS.
<br></li>
<li>A standardized representation for data types.
<br>The Interface is flexible enabling:</li>
</ul><ul><li>An application to construct SQL statements at compile time or at run time <br></li>
<li>An application to use the same object code to access different DBMS products <br></li>
<li>An application to connect to multiple instances of DBMS products <br></li>
<li>An application to send and receive data in a format convenient to the application; the driver converts data values to the format of a specific DBMS product.</li>
