<blockquote><p><nop><a href="http://www.iodbc.org" class="absuri">iODBC.org</a> offers free installers and instructions for the open-source <nop>iODBC Driver Manager and iODBC SDK.
 The installers are packaged with source code, header files, make files, and other resources of interest to the development community.
 These products match <nop></nop>OpenLink Software&#39;s quality and reliability.
 However, they and the iODBC.org web site cater to highly technical individuals who know how to build the iODBC Driver Manager into their own, custom solutions.
 </nop></nop></p> <br><p><nop></nop>OpenLink Software provides commercial quality Data Access Drivers, the <nop></nop>OpenLink Virtuoso Universal Server, diagnostic utilities, and related SDKs.
 In addition, ready-to-run iODBC Driver Manager ports are bundled into the <nop></nop>OpenLink SDKs and installers for Data Access Drivers and <nop></nop>OpenLink Virtuoso.
 This software is intended to service businesses and other entities that need a complete, reliable, out-of-the-box solution.
 Other value added components include <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Mac OS X AQUA- and Frameworks-based ODBC Administrator.</p></blockquote> <br>
