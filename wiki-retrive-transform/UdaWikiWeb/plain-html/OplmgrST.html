<nop></nop><p>OpenLink UDA Single-Tier is a single driver installed on the client only.</p><p>For releases 6.0, the oplmgr process was started automatically by the driver on first connection.
 As of release 6.1, this behaviour has changed; in order to facilitate use of License Manager process for administering licenses of all <nop></nop>OpenLink products simultaneously on the same machine, the license-manager must be started explicitly started in advance of services that will use it.
