<nop></nop><p>OpenLink will introduce support for JDBC connection pooling in the near future.
 In the interim, the JDBC agents do not provide direct support for this 2.0 extension.
 Instead, <nop></nop>OpenLink 4.0 provides multi-threading across the client and server tier.
 This should provide the same speed and functionality associated with JDBC connection pooling.
 Moreover, all of <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Multi-Tier software provides database agent reuse rules.
 These rules can be set to emulate connection pooling.
 Contact Product Support, for additional information.
