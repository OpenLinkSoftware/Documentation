<para>Do you need to connect to an internal or external database from a desktop productivity tool (Spreadsheet, Word Processor, Presentation Package etc.), application development environment, or web application? If so, you may need OpenLink Data Access Drivers.
 The aforementioned application or environment must be ODBC, JDBC, OLEDB, or ADO.NET compliant and use the TCP/IP network protocol.</para><para>If you do not have such a need or your application or environment does not meet these requirements, you probably may not need OpenLink&#39;s Universal Data Access Drivers.
