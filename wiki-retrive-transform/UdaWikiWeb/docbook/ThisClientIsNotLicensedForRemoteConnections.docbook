<listitem> You can also try to make a &quot;shared memory&quot; connection.
 Naturally, Progress itself must be running in <ulink url="HowCanITellIfProgressIsRunningInSocketsOrSharedMemory">shared memory mode</ulink>.
 Additionally, the Multi-Tier Database Agent must be an exact match for your Progress database -- i.e., the database agent must match the letter-version of your Progress instance, and further, the agent must have been &quot;linked&quot; against libraries that all match the versions of your local Progress instance.
  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact"><listitem> If the Agent doesn&#39;t match, <emphasis><emphasis>and</emphasis></emphasis> it is running on a Unix-like OS (Linux, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, etc.), you can <ulink url="RelinkMulti-TierDatabaseAgents">relink the Database Agent</ulink>. </listitem>
<listitem> If the Database Agent doesn&#39;t match and is running on a Windows host, you cannot relink it.
 Your best option is to obtain the appropriate client licensing from Progress Software.</listitem>
