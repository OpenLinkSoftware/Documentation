<para> Enables or disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors.</para><para>When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set to High, the Cursor Library calculates checksums for each row in the current row-set and compares these with the checksums (if any) already stored in the row version cache for the same rows when fetched previously.
 If the checksums differ for a row, the row has been updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to SQL <emphasis>ROW_UPDATED.
 The row version cache is then updated with the latest checksums for the row-set.
 </emphasis></para><para>When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set to Low, (default) performance is improved.
 The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead.
 as the application does not need to detect the row status, SQL <emphasis>ROW_UPDATED.
