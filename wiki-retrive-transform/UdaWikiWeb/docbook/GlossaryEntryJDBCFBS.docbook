 The value passed by /FBS represents the number of rows of resultset data, which you want fetched before data is returned to your client.</para><para>A high /FBS value reduces the need to traverse back and forth across the network.
 However, a high /FBS will result in longer intervals between the arrival of data.
 A smaller /FBS value entails a greater number of trips across the network.
 However, smaller /FBS values alleviate the potential for timeouts, when resultsets are large.</para><para>Finally, /FBS is a shortened form of /FetchBufferSize.</para><para>See Also: /FetchBufferSize, JDBC, Row Buffer Size </para></section></docbook>
