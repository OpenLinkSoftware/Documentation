<para>When configuring a Virtuoso database agent the critical configuration items are:</para><itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact"><listitem> Database Identification - this is the Virtuoso Database Server&#39;s port number, which identifies the actual Virtuoso server process that links you to an actual Virtuoso database file.
 This is the value that you enter into the &quot;Database Name&quot; field of either your Admin Assistant form or wizard dialog.</listitem>

<para>There may be situations in which you are unable to install your OpenLink Request Broker and Database Agents on the same machine as the one hosting your Virtuoso database server.
 Irrespective of the reasons that lead you to this scenario, it is possible to configure your OpenLink database agents hosted on your Application Server machine such that they connect to a remote Virtuoso database on your Database Server machine using Virtuoso&#39;s database specific networking as opposed to OpenLink&#39;s Database Independent Networking.
 The end result being a 3-tier distributed OpenLink architecture in which the communication between OpenLink clients and database agents use OpenLink&#39;s Database independent Networking, while the communication between the Virtuoso database agent and the Virtuoso database server uses Virtuoso database specific networking.</para><para>Configuration Steps:</para><para>Assuming you have a Virtuoso Database Server called &quot;mainserver2&quot; that has a Virtuoso server process listening for clients at port 1112</para><para>1.
 Ensure that you have a usable connection to Virtuoso using its native networking.</para><para>2.
 Add the following value to the &quot;Database Name&quot; field within the Admin Assistant Forms or Wizards used to configure your database agent.
 If you choose to set this value on the client simply enter the same values into the &quot;Database Name&quot; Attribute associated with the configuration of your OpenLink client (see OpenLink ODBC or JDBC or UDBC client configuration for more details):</para><programlisting>      mainserver2:1112
