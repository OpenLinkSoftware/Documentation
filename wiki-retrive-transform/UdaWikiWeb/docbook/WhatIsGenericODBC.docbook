<bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h3">What are the ODBC Lite and Generic ODBC drivers?</bridgehead>
<para>  OpenLink&#39;s ODBC Lite and Generic ODBC drivers perform a special function.
 These drivers enable you to establish ODBC connections to databases, for which OpenLink does not provide a database-specific driver or database agent.
 To proceed, you must possess native or 3rd-party ODBC drivers that connect to your database.
 Then, you must install OpenLink&#39;s ODBC Lite drivers on the machine which contains these drivers.
 Alternatively, you must install the Multi-Tier (MT) Request Broker and Generic ODBC Agent on the machine, which contains these drivers.
 You may then install the Multi-Tier client on any supported operating system.
   Finally, OpenLink&#39;s ODBC Lite and Generic ODBC drivers proxy SQL requests from the application--through the 3rd party Data Source Name--to the actual database.
