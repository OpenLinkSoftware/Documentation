 The active file may also be specified by the $PROSTARTUP environment variable.</para><para>When -inp is increased, you generally must also increase -tok, and the latter is generally recommended to be set to its maximum.
 For example, the following lines would be added to your startup.pf â€” </para><programlisting>-inp 8192     # max value is 32000
-tok 1600     # max value is  1600
</programlisting><para>The Progress server(s) must be restarted after making this change.
