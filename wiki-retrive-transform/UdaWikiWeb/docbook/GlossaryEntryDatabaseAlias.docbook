<para>Database Aliases may be found in the [Database Aliases] section of the OpenLink Session Rules Book.
 You will also find Database Aliases in the Edit Database Aliases portion of the Administrative Assistant.</para><para>The standard Database Alias is an abbreviation for the database to which you want to connect.
 For instance, <computeroutput>sports2000 = spt</computeroutput>.
 However, you may create regular expressions, which map many databases onto one alias.
 For instance, the following expression groups common Progress databases together:</para><programlisting>demo|sports|isports = pro8   
</programlisting><para> This allows you to create a single Mapping Rule, which applies in a variety of cases.
 This insures economy and flexibility in security.
 If you do not employ regular expressions, you will need to create one Mapping Rule per each database.</para><para>See Also: Mapping Rules </para></section></docbook>
