<para>If the License Manager discovers another License Manager is using a license with the same serial number, it will stop allocating licenses and report &quot;License already in use&quot;.</para><para>If the License Manager cannot communicate with the network, it will do the same.</para><para>The OpenLink License Manager uses the multicast IP address <emphasis>224.0.0.24</emphasis> on ports <emphasis>60001/udp</emphasis> and <emphasis>60001/tcp</emphasis> to send and receive communications with other OpenLink components including other License Managers.</para><para>It is becoming common for operating systems to have a default firewall enabled that blocks all network traffic, such that specific ports must be explicitly opened and/or applications must be explicitly granted communications permission.
 In such cases, <emphasis>port 60001 must be opened on both TCP and UDP, for both inbound and outbound communications</emphasis>, and/or oplmgr must be granted similar permissions.
