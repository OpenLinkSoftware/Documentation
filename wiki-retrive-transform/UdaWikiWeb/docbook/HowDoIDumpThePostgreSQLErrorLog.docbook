<para>PostgreSQL has at least three parameters in its postgresql.conf file that control how error logs are cycled.
 These parameters can also be used on the command line.They are:   
</para><table><title /><tgroup><thead /><tbody>
<row><entry>Parameter</entry><entry>Use</entry></row>
<row><entry>log_ rotation_ age</entry><entry>Passes the number of minutes after which a new log is to be created. Set to zero to disable.For use with redirect_ stderr.</entry></row>
<row><entry>log_ rotation_ size</entry><entry>Passes the maximum size of the log file in kilobytes. Once the log file reaches that size, a new log is created. Set to zero to disable. For use with redirect_ stderr. </entry></row>
<row><entry>log_ truncate_ on_ rotation</entry><entry>Causes PostgreSQL to truncate rather than overwrite logs.</entry></row>
</tbody></tgroup></table>
