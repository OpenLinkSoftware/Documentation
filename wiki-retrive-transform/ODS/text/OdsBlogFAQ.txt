All your posts are displayed in reverse-chronological order, the latest 
post being displayed on top.

   * Categories: You can categorize each post by picking one or more 
categories. Your readers can then browse your posts by category.
   * Calendar and archives: Just as via categories, you can 
browse people's posts via the calendar or archives tab. Via the 
calendar, you can look at posts for each day while browsing through 
the archives will give you longer time frames. 
   * Search and Advanced 
Search - Plus there's the search function that you will find on most 
of the blogs which can of course deliver fast and accurate results 
to you.

---+++What are comments?

Comments are usually short articles from other people regarding a post 
you have written. You can always leave comments regarding certain posts. 
Other readers can again comment on these comments. Also, readers leave 
an email or the internet address of his or her blog with the comment 
so people can learn a bit more about the person.

However, please beware that spamming other people's blogs by including 
commercial ads in your comments is NOT welcome.

---+++What is RSS?

RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication which enables you to notify 
other people about your new blog entries. You post your Web log entries 
in the XML specification RSS. News readers all over the world can view 
your blog entries on content aggregators.

item, or web page if it has one.

---+++What RSS versions are supported?

---+++What is a tag?

A tag works like a keyword. Like categories, they are used to describe 
people, groups, or posts. You can tag a post with several tags separated 
by commas.

could be: 
<verbatim>
holiday, Australia, down under, sun, hot, Melbourne, Sydney, dingos.

modify items shown on your Weblog Home page, example Amazon Search or 
<nowiki>AltaVista's</nowiki> <nowiki>BableFish</nowiki> translator. 
Another option is choose another template under the Settings ->

<nowiki>MetaWeblog</nowiki> or Movable Type protocols and through 
moblogging you can use your mobile phone or PDA to post to your 
OpenLink Virtuoso Weblog.

---+++What is a blogroll?

A Blogroll is a collection of links to your favorite blogs which are 
usually placed on your blog homepage.

---+++What is a permalink?

Permalink, short for "permanent link", is the permanent internet 
address of a post. This is important, as most blogs change regularly, 
and without a permanent link, the posts would be impossible to find 
later.

Permalinks are usually indicated by a hash (#) or the permalink at 
the end of the post.

---+++What is Trackback?

<nowiki>TrackBack</nowiki> is a tool to allow you to notify other blog 
authors of your blog posts. Most bloggers use it to comment on a blog 
post as an entry on their site, rather than as comments on the other 
blog. It's similar to linking to a permalink but it adds the 
functionality where you actually tell the original blogger that you've 
linked to them. This is called "sending a ping".
 
Here's an example:

   * First, Kingsley has a blog on Virtuoso Universal Server Linked 
Tables.
   * Mitko, who has is interested in Virtuoso Universal Server, reads 
Kingsley's blog.
   * Mitko has just written an article regarding Virtualization that 
would perfectly supplement Kingsley's last post. Mitko creates his post 
and believes all of Kingsley's readers will want read this article.
   * So, Mitko copies the Trackback-URL of Kingsley's post into his 
Trackback function. Then, Mitko's blog sends a message to Kingsley's 
post and Kingsley's post will display the "Trackback", which will 
indicate there is another article to view on that subject.
 
---+++How to Give My Blog Content Tags Meaning via MOAT Ontology?

MOAT (Meaning Of A Tag) provides a Semantic Web framework to publish semantically-annotated content from free-tagging.
For more information about Virtuoso MOAT Server and ODS support you can read [[VirtMOATSettings][here]]. 
Here is a scenario showing how this ontology can be used in Weblog post message:

   * Suppose you have defined MOAT server and have defined a rule set with name "paris" for ex.
   * In the New post form enter in the Tag section tag "paris"
   * Now when you go to the MOAT tab you can associate your tag with the offered concepts

---+++ How to Hyperlink Content in My Blog?

   * Suppose you have entered as above MOAT server and have defined a rule set with name "paris".
   * Go to ODS Settings->Content Hyperlinking
   * Click the "Import from MOAT" button.
   * Select an URI and phrase from the retrieved ones. Note that for one phrase only 1 URI can be imported.
   * As result the prase for hyperlink will be added
   * Now go to your Weblog instance
   * Click the link "New post" and enter in the form:
      1. for Title: my second blog test
      2. for Message: Where is paris?
   * Click the button "Post" and go to Home.
   * As result the phrase "paris" will be shown as a link in the new post body, and this link will lead to the URI you have selected when importing from MOAT from above.
