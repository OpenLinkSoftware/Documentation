---+++What is MOAT?
MOAT (Meaning Of A Tag) provides a Semantic Web framework to publish semantically-annotated 
content from free-tagging.

While tags are widely used in Web 2.0 services, their lack of machine-understandable meaning 
can be a problem for information retrieval, especially when people use tags that can have 
different meanings depending on the context.

MOAT aims to solve this by providing a way for users to define meaning(s) of their tag(s) 
using URIs of Semantic Web resources (such as URIs from [[http://dbpedia.org/][DBpedia]], 
[[http://geonames.org/][GeoNames]], or any knowledge base), and then annotate content with 
those URIs rather than free-text tags, leveraging content into Semantic Web, by 
[[http://linkeddata.org/][linking]] data together. Moreover, tag meanings can be shared 
between people, providing an architecture of participation to define and exchange potential 
meanings of tags within a community of users. 

To achieve this goal, MOAT relies on an architecture that can be deployed for any 
organization or community and that involves a lightweight ontology, a MOAT server, and 
some third-party clients.


---+++MOAT Server

MOAT Server is a application that serves tag meanings (in HTML, JSON or RDF/XML, using 
content negotiation for any Tag you request. The server is shipped without any data, 
which means that users have first to define meanings for their tags (thanks to the 
clients they use, that will then update the server information) to efficiently use it, 
using data available on the Semantic Web, especially from the Linked Data initiative.

A Virtuoso instance that has one or more MOAT meanings is a valid MOAT server. When 
accessed the following URL, returns as result a valid MOAT RDF:
<verbatim>
http://host:port/dataspace/tag/<tag-name>
</verbatim>

For example http://myopenlink.net/dataspace/tag/test returns the MOAT RDF file:
<verbatim>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<rdf:RDF
      xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
      xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
      xmlns:moat="http://moat-project.org/ns#"
      xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">

<moat:Tag rdf:about="http://myopenlink.net/dataspace/tag/test">
  <moat:name><![CDATA[test]]></moat:name>

</moat:Tag>

</rdf:RDF>
</verbatim>

---+++Using the MOAT Ontology to Give Meaning to my Data Space Content Tags

   1. Log in to ODS as administrator
   1. Go to Site Settings->Web Application Configuration
   1. In the shown form enter "MOAT server" and "MOAT server key" fields. For ex:
      1. Enter for "MOAT server": <code><nowiki>http://tags.moat-project.org/</nowiki></code>
      1. Enter for "MOAT server key": <code>tagging</code>
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/mt1.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Click the "Set" button.

---++++Content Tagging Settings

   1. Login as regular user
   1. Go to Settings->Content Tagging Settings
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/mt2.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Click Add New Rule
   1. Enter "Ruleset Name". For example: <code>paris</code>
   1. In the "Tagging Rules" section enter:
      1. For "Query" and "Tag" for example: <code>paris</code>
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/mt3.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
      1. Click the Add button.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/mt4.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. As result in the "Action" column will be shown the "MOAT" button. Click it.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/mt5.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Add for "Meaning URL" for example: <code><nowiki>http://google.com?q=paris</nowiki></code> and click the button "Add" or 
you can also click the "Import meanings" button. This will cause a request to the entered 
from above MOAT server and will return as result if found meaning URLs for the relevant tag 
such as for example:
<verbatim>   
http://sws.geonames.org/2988507/
http://sws.geonames.org/4402
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris
</verbatim>

   1. Click the "Save" button.
   1. Now in the Ruleset form click the "Save" button.

---+++Hyperlinking Notes

   * [[ODSWeblogAutomaticHyperlinking][ODS Weblog Automatic Hyperlinking Notes]]

---+++How to stop the Automatic Links for a relevant string?

At the moment, you cannot stop Automatic Links only for a chosen string.  You can turn 
them off for an entire post, by including the following tag anywhere in the article --
<verbatim>
<no-auto-href />
</verbatim>
OpenLink recommends that the author always place the 
<code><nowiki>&lt;no-auto-href /&gt;</nowiki></code> at the very end and/or the very 
beginning of a post, so it is easily visible to later editors.
