---+ ODS Webmail Example for Encrypting Emails using special search of the recipient's Public Key by domain

ODS Webmail offers the feature of sending encrypted message to recipient by gathering information for the recipient using [[http://xrdprovisioning.net/specs/1.0/wd01/xrd-provisioning-1.0-wd01.html][XRD Provisioning Protocol]].

Assume John wants to send encrypted email message to Kate, and Kate does not share her public key to John and John does not have Kate in his AddressBook contacts. Instead, when John attempts to send encrypted email message to recipient for ex: <b><nowiki>kate@mytest.com</nowiki></b>, then the system perform search by the given recipient domain, using the XRD protocol, if there is registered user in ODS with the given mail. In case of found, next the system checks if the user has X.509 Certificate. If found, request its public key. When the public key is retrieved successfully, the message should be send successfully and then retrieved from Kate her ODS Webmail Inbox.

The scenario from below describes these steps:


---++Prerequisites

   1. Perform the steps from the [[OdsMailInstallGuide][Virtuoso ODS-Mail Installation Guide]].
      * In our example we will use for domain name: mytest.com
   1 Install the ODS Addressbook vad package: [[https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/download/][<nowiki>ods_addressbook_dav</nowiki>.vad]]
   1 Set the Virtuoso Server HTTP port and DefaultHost  from [URIQA] section in the ini section by default to be 80:
<verbatim>
...
[HTTPServer]
ServerPort                  = 8893
...
[URIQA]
DefaultHost = mytest.com:8893
...
</verbatim>
   1 Make sure, for ex. for Windows users, to set the domain i.e. <b>mytest.com</b> in C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc.\host:
<verbatim>
...
127.0.0.1       mytest.com
...
</verbatim>

---++Configure ODS User and Webmail settings

   1 Register user John with email for ex.: <b><nowiki>john@yahoo.com</nowiki></b>

   1 Register user Kate respectively with email for ex.: <b><nowiki>kate@mytest.com</nowiki></b>
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/e29.png" />%BR%%BR%

%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/e6.png" />%BR%%BR%
      1 Click "Create and Launch Application" 
   1 John [[ODSGenerateX509Certificate][creates X.509 Certificate]] with mail <b><nowiki>john@mytest.com</nowiki></b>.
   1 Kate [[ODSGenerateX509Certificate][creates X.509 Certificate]] with mail <b><nowiki>kate@mytest.com</nowiki></b>.
   1 John exports his X.509 Certificate, for ex. to local file with name <b>john.p12</b>.
   1 Kate exports her X.509 Certificate, for ex. to local file with name <b>kate.p12</b>.
   1 Kate imports the content of her certificate in ODS Profile Edit->Security->X.509 Certificates.

      1 Click "Import key from local file" and respectively for John select his certificate john.p12 and for Kate select her certificate kate.p12:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/e14.png" />%BR%%BR%
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/e15.png" />%BR%%BR%
      1 Enter "Key Name" for ex. respectively for John: <b>JohnKey</b> and for Kate: <b>KateKey</b> and provide the certificate password:

   1 John configures his Webmail Settings:
      1 Go to Webmail instance->Preferences and set:
         1 For "Encryption (with certificate)": select the "JohnKey" key.
         1 Select "Required (can't send message unless all recipients have certificates)"
