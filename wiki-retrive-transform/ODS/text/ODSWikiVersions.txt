---++Manage Wiki Articles Versions Control

ODS Wiki supports articles versions control:

   * Below the body of each article are shown the versions with links so to be viewed.
   * Also differences between two versions can be checked by clicking the ">" link shown for ex. like this:
<verbatim>
 1.2 > 1.3
</verbatim>

---+++Sample Scenario

The following steps present how to manage versions for a wiki article:

   1 Go to http://demo.openlinksw.com/ods
   1 Log in as user demo with password demo
   1 Go to Wiki
   1 Enter a wiki article name for ex. <nowiki>VirtuosoSponger</nowiki> and click enter.
   1 As result should be shown the wiki form for creating the WikiWord
   1 Enter in the text area some text, for ex:
<verbatim>
The Virtuoso Sponger is a middleware component of Virtuoso.
</verbatim>
      * <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/w1.png" style="wikiautogen"/>
   1 Click the "Save and release lock" button.
   1 As result the WikiWord <nowiki>VirtuosoSponger</nowiki> will be created and will be shown version 1.1 at the bottom of the page:
      * <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/w2.png" style="wikiautogen"/>
   1 Now let's edit the text. Click the "Edit" link shown below the article body.
   1 Change the text by adding to it:
<verbatim>
 that generates RDF Linked Data from a variety of data sources.
</verbatim>
   1 So the text should be:
<verbatim>
The Virtuoso Sponger is a middleware component of Virtuoso that generates RDF Linked Data from a variety of data sources.
</verbatim>
      * <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/w3.png" style="wikiautogen"/>
   1 Click the "Save and release lock" button.
   1 As result the changes will be saved and will be shown version 1.2 and 1.1 at the bottom of the page:
      * <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/w4.png" style="wikiautogen"/>
   1 To view the differences between the versions, click the "&gt;" sign shown between them:
      * <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/w5.png" style="wikiautogen"/>
   1 The newer version is shown with green, the older is shown with red background of the text
   1 From this page you can go to the History page where you can manage the current versions of the article. Click the "Back to the history" button
   1 From the manage wiki versions page you can perform the following actions per version:
      1 Delete - deletes the version
      1 Undo - reverts the changes to previous state
      1 Rollback - performs rollback to the previous version and automatically creates a new version
