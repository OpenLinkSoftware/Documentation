---+Manipulate my Addressbook data via CRUD RESTful using Addressbook CardDAV Endpoint

%TOC%


---++What?
AddressBook CRUD (<b>C</b>reate, <b>R</b>ead, <b>U</b>pdate, <b>D</b>elete) Endpoint Service.

---++Why?
Using CRUD RESTful Endpoint service provides an easy way to manage contacts.

---++How?
Knowing an Addressbook CRUD Endpoint Service endpoint URL, one can perform the following activities:
   * Copy-paste vCard files containing contacts. So once pasted, the system creates the contacts;
   * Edit contact(s);
   * Update contact(s);
   * Delete contact(s);
   * Update RDF Data for the Addressbook instance. Depending on the instance's model:
      * When model is "Closed", will be updated the RDF Data for the instance's private graph:
<verbatim>
http://cname/dataspace/protected/[name-of-the-instance]
</verbatim>
      * When model is "Opened", will be updated the RDF Data for the ODS Dataspace public graph:
<verbatim>
http://cname/dataspace/[name-of-the-instance]
</verbatim>



---+++Example with Addressbook instance that has Member model from type "Closed" and is not set "Visible to public"

   1. Suppose a user, for ex. "demo", has created Addressbook instance with name "demoAddressBook" and <code>Member model</code> is "Closed":

   1 Mount the Addressbook CardDAV Endpoint URL <code> http://localhost:8890/DAV/home/demo/addressbooks/demoAddressBook/</code>

%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/abcrud3.png" />%BR%%BR%
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/abcrud4.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Drop a .vcf file, for ex. kidehen.vcf into the mapped CardDAV Addressbook folder:
<verbatim>
-- kidehen.vcf
