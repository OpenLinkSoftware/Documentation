---++ OpenLink Data Spaces

---+++ Overview

ODS gives you a full range of common web applications that you can host yourself. It frees you from dependence on a myriad of separate and non-integrated hosted applications and gives you control on how you appear to the web and semantic web. ODS can be used for setting up hosted services, for corporate intra and extranets or run on your PC as a privately hosted point of presence.

ODS is more than an integrated suite of common web applications. It is the basis for a web presence that covers conventional content for human consumption such as blogs as well as exposes the same content for the semantic web. ODS offers all standard feed formats, RSS, ATOM, FOAF and more where meaningful, all ODS data support tagging and are searchable via a common interface, supporting text as well as tags.

The next release of ODS will feature [[VOSSPARQL][SPARQL]] and URIQA access to all data that users choose to make publicly available.
