---++Wiki Atom based upstream support

ODSWiki now supports Atom based upstreaming. Any cluster can be configured to escalate any changes to one or several remoted ODS Wiki instances.

---+++ Configuration

Upstreaming can be configured in =Cluster Settings= page in =Upstreams= tab.

The form for adding or changing existing upstream contains following fields:

| * Field * | * Value *|
| name | name of the upstream - list of upstreams actually a list of such names |
| URL    | URL of remote ODSWiki Atom endpoint. Usually it is something like =http://{server}[:port]/dataspace/{ownername}/wiki/{clustername}/atom-pub |
| user  | name of user who has write permissions on the remote ODSWiki instance |
| password | password of *user* |    

---+++Important Notes

   1. Do not run upstreaming as the dav user lest it risk overwriting unrelated articles.
   1. A change that comes about via upstream constitutes a new version number on the page in the destination wiki cluster.
   1. The page in the destination cluster may be locally modified between upstreams
   1. An upstream request will have no effect on pages in the source that have not been modified since the last upstream
   1. When the version number of a page the source cluster is incremented, upstreams will take effect
   1. Local modifications in the destination cluster will be overwritten by subsequent changes in the source (but not until the source is changed).
   1. If you see "HTTP/401 Precondition Failed" this means you need the same version of the ODS-Wiki VAD package on both the source and destination instances; this is a new check to ensure attachments may be safely transferred in the Atom stream.

---+++Simple example:

   * Note: At myopenlink.net:8890/ods :
