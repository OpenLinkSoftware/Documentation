The OLE DB to ODBC Provider is implemented as an OLEDB - ODBC bridge provider, utilizing ODBC data sources for connectivity to databases, much like the Microsoft ODBC Provider. 

The [[OpenLink]]  Multi-Tier Drivers for Postgres are a Type C class provider bound to the ODBC Driver Manager enabling the connectivity to any ODBC Data source including the [[OpenLink]]  Multi-Tier and Single-Tier or any third party ODBC driver.
