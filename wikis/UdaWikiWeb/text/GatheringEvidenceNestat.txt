===netstat -a===

The netstat -a command returns important information about your TCP and UDP ports. To produce a netstat -a output, take the following action:

1. Access the affected computer's command line.
2. Run the following command:

{{{
netstat -a > netstat.out
}}}

3. Locate the netstat.out file.
4. Forward the netstat.out file to <nop>OpenLink Product Support.

Be advised. If a <nop>OpenLink Multi-Tier client produces "Program Unavailable," "Remote System Error," "Unknown Host," or UDP broadcast errors, run netstat -a on both your client and server.
