= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for ODBC Data Sources (a/k/a the ODBC-to-ODBC Bridge Driver), for Windows =

%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements==

* Your target data source must be SQL compliant. 
* You must possess enough knowledge to establish an ODBC connection to this database using third-party or native ODBC drivers. 

== Software Requirements ==

* You need to know whether the client application is 32-bit or 64-bit. The Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for ODBC Data Sources must match the bit format of the client application.
* You must possess third-party or native drivers that connect to your target database. 
#* A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as <nop>OpenLink's Lite drivers.
#* The local client portion of these drivers must match the bit format of the client application and the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for ODBC Data Sources.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* Your environment must be configured to enable connectivity using your local ODBC driver. <nop>OpenLink Product Support can provide minimal assistance in this area. Ideally, you will use your drivers to create a System DSN for maximum compatibility.
* You must know the exact name of one or more DSNs that connect to your target data source.
