== <nop>OpenLink Single-tier Components (*nix) for <nop>MySQL==

=== Aims and Intentions=== 

This guide is intended to enable competent system administrators to install and configure <nop>OpenLink Multi-tier client side components on *nix style operating systems in a few steps as possible.

This guide does not explain any of the non-pertinent features encountered along the way. Such explanations may be found in the full documentation.

===Prerequisites===

* You **MUST** be proficient in using a Unix shell.
* You **MUST** be proficient in using a Unix editor such as vi
* You **MUST** be in possession of relevant database connectivity details such as Database name, Username, password, etc.

===Installation===

# Log onto the machine and create a suitable <nop>OpenLink installation directory &lt;<nop>OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;%BR%
# Copy all relevant components to &lt;<nop>OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;%BR%%BR% At bare minimum, these will be the <nop>OpenLink ODBC Driver for <nop>MySQL, <nop>OpenLink Http Administration Assistant%BR% and <nop>OpenLink license file.%BR%
# Install using the "install.sh" shell script --
{{{
 #sh install.sh

}}}
# You should take care to enter correct information when prompted pertaining to ports, passwords, etc and ensure that you note these down for future use.%BR%
# The installation should finish without error.

===Configuration===
====Data Souce====
Open the file &lt;<nop>OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;/bin/odbc.ini with a suitable text editor such as vi.%BR%
Locate and edit the sample <nop>OpenLink MySQL ODBC data source (DSN) created during the installation process and edit as follows--

====Sample <nop>MySQL 3.x Data Source====
{{{
 
 [mysql]
 Driver            = &lt;OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;/lib/mys3_mt_lt.so
 ServerType        = MySQL 3.x
 Options           = -H mysql3.hostname
 Database          = database
 UserName          = mysql
 Password          = **********
 FetchBufferSize   = 99
 ReadOnly          = no
 DeferLongFetch    = no
 JetFix            = no
 Description       = Sample MySQL 3.x Lite Connection

}}}
====Sample <nop>MySQL 4.x Data Source====
{{{
 
 [mysql]
 Driver            = &lt;OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;/lib/mys4_mt_lt.so
 ServerType        = MySQL 4.x
 Options           = -H mysql4.hostname
 Database          = database
 UserName          = mysql
 Password          = **********
 FetchBufferSize   = 99
 ReadOnly          = no
 DeferLongFetch    = no
 JetFix            = no
 Description       = Sample MySQL 5.x Lite Connection

}}}
====Sample <nop>MySQL 5.x Data Source====
{{{
 
 [mysql]
 Driver            = &lt;OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;/lib/mys5_mt_lt.so
 ServerType        = MySQL 5.x
 Options           = -H mysql5.hostname
 Database          = database
 UserName          = mysql
 Password          = **********
 FetchBufferSize   = 99
 ReadOnly          = no
 DeferLongFetch    = no
 JetFix            = no
 Description       = Sample MySQL 5.x Lite Connection

}}}


===Testing===
Use the {{{iodbctest}}} tool which is packaged with the HTTP-based <nop>OpenLink ODBC Administrator as follows -- 
{{{
 
 #cd &lt;OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;
 #. ./openLink.sh
 # iodbctest mysql
 iODBC Demonstration program
 This program shows an interactive SQL processor
 Driver Manager: 03.52.0507.0105
 Driver: 06.02.1217 OpenLink Generic ODBC Driver (oplodbc.so) 

 SQL>

}}}

You should now be able to issue <nop>SQL statements directly against the target database.

====Additional Information====

* The bitness of the ODBC Driver for <nop>MySQL is determined by the bitness of your ODBC client application.%BR%%BR%That is, if your ODBC client application is 32-bit then the Generic ODBC Driver component **MUST** also be 32-bit.
