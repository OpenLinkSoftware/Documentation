%TOC%

   
`Use Extended Fetch'' controls whether the [[OpenLink]]  ODBC Bridge agent/Lite uses the [[SQLExtendedFetch]]  () function of the underlying ODBC driver, if it's available, when fetching data. Using the bridged driver's [[SQLExtendedFetch]]  () should improve performance. However it may be necessary to disable this setting- for instance, some drivers do not support extended fetching on a result-set produced by an ODBC catalog call. 

When extended fetching is disabled, the bridged driver's SQLFetch() function is used instead.
