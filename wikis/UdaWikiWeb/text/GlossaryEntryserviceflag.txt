===+service===

+service is an option which may be passed to the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker or Virtuoso service. +service takes its own parameters, as well. For instance, you may pass +service start. This will start Virtuoso or the Broker. Likewise, you may pass +service stop. This will terminate Virtuoso or the Broker. For a complete list of +service functions, use your command line to descend into your product's /bin subdirectory. Then, type in the command, which you normally use to start your service. However, add -? to the end of that command.
