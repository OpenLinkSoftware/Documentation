===Client host or user {{{([username@machinename.domainname])}}} is not trusted by the server (-956).===


When this error is encountered, /etc/hosts.equiv on the Informix host must be edited to include the Broker host and Broker-running userid. For example, if the Broker and Informix instance were both running on the same host, test.openlinksw.com, and the error were as shown, and the user openlink were running the Broker --
    
    
{{{
[Informix Server]Client host or user ([openlink@test.openlinksw.com]) is not trusted by theserver (-956).    
}}}

  -- the following line would need to be added to /etc/hosts.equiv --
    
    
{{{
test.openlinksw.com openlink    
}}}

As DNS responses can vary over time, usually because responses sometimes come from different DNS servers, <nop>OpenLink would generally advise adding a few more lines, to cover the most common permutations --
    
    
{{{
test.openlinksw.com openlink
localhost openlink
127.0.0.1 openlink
10.4.3.2 openlink
test openlink
}}}

In a three-tier connection, with Informix running on informix.openlinksw.com and the Broker still on test.openlinksw.com, similar entries would be required, dropping the localhost and 127.0.0.1 permutations, but keeping the FQDN (fully-qualified domain name, test.openlinksw.com), basic hostname (test), and IP address (10.4.3.2) permutations of the remote Broker host. These edits would be applied to /etc/hosts.equiv on informix.openlinksw.com, not on test.openlinksw.com.
    
{{{
test.openlinksw.com openlink
10.4.3.2 openlink
test openlink    
}}}
