= Multi-Tier Connection Attributes =

There are two types of Multi-Tier Connection Attributes: "User-Configurable" and "Non-User-Configurable".

==User-Configurable Connection Attributes==

User-Configurable attributes are set in various ways, depending on the connection mechanism.

* ODBC: in the ODBC DSN, typically through the ODBC Administrator, or the ODBC Connect String
* JDBC: in the JDBC URL, or, with JDBC 2.0 or later, the JDBC DSN
* ADO.NET: in the Connection String

**Domain Attribute**
Identifies the Multi-Tier Agent to which all the Multi-Tier Connection Attributes will apply.

This attribute describes a logical reference for a database type, Multi-Tier agent type, or anything else you would like to use as a logical identifier for all the other Multi-Tier Connection Attributes.

This attribute is also referred to as the "Server Type" or "SVT" attribute of a Multi-Tier Generic Client connect string. It is also referred to in older product documentation as the Multi-Tier "Provider Type".

**User Attribute**
Identifies the User making use of a Multi-Tier Generic Client.

**Database Attribute**
Identifies a specific database name (a/k/a "schema" or "catalog") within a database environment (e.g., {{{ORCL}}} for Oracle, {{{stores7}}} for Informix, {{{pubs}}} with Sybase or Microsoft SQL Server, {{{iSports}}} for Progress). The values associated with this Connection Attribute aren't overridden by Aliases; however, they may be overridden by the "Database" attribute within an Agent Configuration template.

**<nop>ServerOpts (Database Server Environment Options) Attribute**
Identifies a set of database environment initialization parameters, currently this attribute only applies to Progress environments. It is used to set self-serving client initialization parameters such as: {{{-TB}}}, {{{-TB}}}, {{{-q}}}, {{{-D mdy}}}, etc. The values associated with this Connection Attribute aren't overridden by Aliases; instead, they are overridden by the {{{ServerOptions}}} attribute within an Agent Configuration template.

**<nop>ConnectOpts (Database Server Connection Options) Attribute**
Identifies a set of database server connection parameters used to initiate a connection with a backend database server process. This is how a Multi-Tier Database Agent makes a connection with a back-end database server using a particular database vendors networking middleware (e.g., Net8 or SQL*Net for Oracle, I-Connect or I-Net for Informix, Progress Client Networking for Progress, Open Client for Sybase). The values associated with this Connection Attribute aren't overridden by Aliases, instead they are overridden by the {{{ConnectOptions}}} attribute within an Agent Configuration template.

== Non-User-Configurable Connection Attributes==

These attributes are environmental in nature, and are derived automatically by a Multi-Tier Generic Client.

**<nop>OpSys (Operating System) attribute**
Identifies the Client operating system from which the Multi-Tier Generic Client is being executed.
Machine attribute

**Host attribute** 
Identifies the Network Alias or IP address of the machine or device from the Multi-Tier Client is being executed.

**Application attribute**
Identifies the Client Application from which the connection originates.

<i><b>Note:</b> The Application name can be set by an application using an ODBC API call, {{{SQLSetConnectOption(hdbc, SQL_APPLICATION_NAME, "AppName")}}}. The JDBC equivalent can also be used.</i>

**Mode attribute**
Identifies the session Mode required by an Multi-Tier Client, this may be Read-Only or Read-Write.
