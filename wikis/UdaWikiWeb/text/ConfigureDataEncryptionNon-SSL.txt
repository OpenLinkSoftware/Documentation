<p><nop>OpenLink's Multi-Tier Universal Data Access solution permits simplex and duplex encryption, for maximum flexibility according to the user's needs.  (Single-Tier does not presently support encrypted communications.)</p>

<p>Simplex is one-way, encrypting all communications sent from the <nop>OpenLink Generic Client to the <nop>OpenLink Server (Request Broker or Database Agent), or from the Server to the Client.  Duplex simply combines these two, resulting in fully secure communications between <nop>OpenLink Client and Server.  </p>

<p>Data encryption will have some impact on performance because additional work is being performed before the data is presented to the calling application.  There is always some trade-off between security and speed.  However, we have optimized our encryption algorithms to minimize this overhead.  </p>

<p><b>Client configuration</b></p>
<p>Client data encryption is configured through the<tt> <nop>OpenLink Client Configuration Utility</tt>, on Windows and Mac OS, or through the HTTP-based<tt>  <nop>OpenLink ODBC Administrator</tt>, on Unix.  The<tt> <nop>DataEncryption</tt> value in the<tt> odbc.ini</tt> file's<tt> [Communications]</tt> stanza may also be manually edited on Mac OS or Unix; on Windows, this setting is found in the Registry at<tt> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\OPENLINK.INI\Communications\DataEncryption</tt>.  </p>
<p>This section key can be set to<tt> Yes</tt> or<tt> 1</tt> to enable data encryption, and to<tt> No</tt> or<tt> 0</tt> to disable it.  </p>

<p>When enabled, this setting will cause all communications from the Client to the Request Broker or Database Agent to be encrypted.  <i>This does <b>not</b> cause data returned from the Request Broker or Database Agent to be encrypted.</i></p>


<p><b>Server configuration</b></p>
<p>Request Broker and Database Agent data encryption is configured through the<tt> [Communications]</tt> stanza of the Rulebook,<tt> oplrqb.ini</tt>.  The HTTP-based<tt> <nop>OpenLink Admin Assistant</tt> may be used for this configuration (<tt>Server Components Administration &gt;&gt; Request Broker Administration &gt;&gt; Configure Request Broker's Parameters by Form &gt;&gt; Communications Parameters</tt>), or the Rulebook (<tt>oplrqb.ini</tt>) may be manually edited.  </p>

<p>The<tt> <nop>DataEncryption</tt> key should be set to<tt> Yes</tt> or<tt> 1</tt> to enable data encryption.  To disable data encryption, use <tt> No</tt> or<tt> 0</tt>. </p>

<p>When enabled, this setting will cause all communications from the Request Broker or Database Agent to the Client to be encrypted.  <i>This does <b>not</b> cause data returned from the Client to be encrypted.</i></p>
