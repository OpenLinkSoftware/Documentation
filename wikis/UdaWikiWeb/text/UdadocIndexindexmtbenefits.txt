High-Performance 32 Bit ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET and OLE-DB Drivers that provide transparent access to remote databases from any compliant application. These include Desktop Productivity Tools such as Spreadsheets, Word Processors, J2EE applications, Client & Application Server Application Development Environments, Web based Database Publishing Tools and Computer Telephony Integration packages are just a few of the many products that can take advantage of our standards compliance. 

The session rules book provides a policy based security scheme that is basically a logical data access firewall. It is described as such because it allows the system administrators to govern all the rules of engagement for [[OpenLink]]  ODBC sessions and it does so across user accounts, client application, client operating systems, database names, machine aliases, a user defined rules domain, and any combination of these attributes. You can optionally encrypt all communication between the [[OpenLink]]  Client and Server Components. 

By implementing the Rendezvous service discovery protocol, as a result it is now possible to administer all of your [[OpenLink]]  Data Access clients from one or more servers. The clients simply perform network lookups for the Rendezvous aware request brokers then bind/associate themselves with the servers, and all the client side connection parameter values are retrieved from the selected server prior to connection time. 

HTML and HTTP based interface for configuring [[OpenLink]]  server components. This implies that with an Internet connection, and the appropriate network access privileges, you can now administer your [[OpenLink]]  server components (which also means your clients as a result of [[ZeroConfig]]  support).
