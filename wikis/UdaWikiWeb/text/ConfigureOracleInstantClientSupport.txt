= Making Connections through the Oracle Instant Client =

Our Single-Tier "Lite" Edition drivers and Multi-Tier "Enterprise" Edition database agents can communicate with remote Oracle databases through the Oracle Instant Client libraries. Instant Client allows you to run applications without installing the full Oracle client (SQL*Net or Net8/9/10/11) or having an {{{ORACLE_HOME}}}. It supports two basic connection string formats:

* {{{[username[:password]@]//host[:port][/service name]}}}, e.g. {{{//dbase-server-5:4321/ORDERS}}}
* an Oracle Net keyword-value pair such as
{{{      (DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp) (HOST=dlsun242)
          (PORT=5521)) (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=bjava21)))}}}

Naming methods that use a configuration file (such as {{{tnsnames.ora}}} or {{{sqlnet.ora}}}) for name translation are also possible, if the environment variable {{{TNS_ADMIN}}} is set to point to the directory containing the file.

Oracle documentation: 
* [[http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/oci/instantclient/ic-faq.html#A4428|connection string formats]]
* [[http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/oci/instantclient/index.html|Oracle 10g Instant Client]]


Additionally, the {{{ORACLE_HOME}}} and relevant library path variables must point to the root of the Oracle Instant Client installation. These variables appear in the environment and various configuration files.

Follow the instructions appropriate to your driver and OS, to ensure that your environment and configuration files are properly configured.

# Log in to your client machine.
# Use the sh or bash command to open a bourne or bash shell.
# cd into the root of your Single-Tier driver installation.
# Execute this command: {{{. ./openlink.sh}}}
# Execute this command: {{{echo $ORACLE_HOME}}}
# Use export to set {{{ORACLE_HOME}}} to the root of your local Instant Client Installation, as needed.
# Use the echo command to display your library path. For example:
#* AIX: {{{echo $LIBPATH}}}
#* HP-UX: {{{echo $SHLIB_PATH}}}
#* Other: {{{echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}}
# Use export to append the root of the Instant Client installation to your library path, as needed. 
# cd into the bin sub-directory of your Single-Tier driver installation.
# Use a text editor to open the {{{openlink.ini}}} file.
