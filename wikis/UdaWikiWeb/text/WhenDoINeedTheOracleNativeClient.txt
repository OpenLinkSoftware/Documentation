==When do I need the Oracle native client?==

There are two scenarios in which you would require the Oracle native client. You must install the Oracle client on the same machine as any Oracle Single-Tier driver. Additionally, you must install the Oracle client on the same machine as <nop>OpenLink's Multi-Tier Request Broker and Oracle Database Agent, if the Broker and Oracle Agent do not reside on the same machine as the Oracle database.
