==Database Configuration for Unicode==

===Progress 9.1 (SQL-92)===

The Progress database can be set to use the UTF-8 Unicode codepage. The SQL-92 Client can be also be set to use Unicode. The SQL-92 server uses the codepage of the connected database as its internal codepage. Conversion between the database codepage and the SQL-92 client codepage is done by the server. There are no specific functions provided for converting between codepages within an ESQL-92 program.

The easiest way to create to Progress Unicode-enabled database is to use the "{{{proutil}}}" program to convert an existing database to {{{UTF-8}}} format using the following command:
{{{
proutil <db-name> -C convchar convert utf-8
}}}

Multibyte characters can be used in character ({{{CHAR}}}) and variable-length character ({{{VARCHAR}}}) fields. Character string literals and the arguments to string functions can also be multibyte characters. 

There are some provisos for specific functions noted in the Progress documentation. 
* Importantly, when the SQL-92 language element syntax requires single quotes, double quotes, parentheses, or braces, the requirement is for the single-byte ASCII encoding of these characters and other encodings are **//not//** equivalent. 
* The string operators in Progress SQL-92 consider the unit of length to be the character count, not a byte or column count.
* When a column of type {{{CHAR}}} or {{{VARCHAR}}} is created, the maximum length specified is a number of characters, so the actual number of bytes storage required depends on the database codepage. The length of character data returned in the {{{sqlda}}} is in bytes, not characters.
