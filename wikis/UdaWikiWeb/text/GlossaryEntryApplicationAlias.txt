===Application Alias===

<i>Application Aliases</i> may be found in the [Application Aliases] section of the <nop>OpenLink Session Rules Book. You will also find <i>Application Aliases</i> in the Edit Client Application Aliases portion of the Administrative Assistant. The standard Application Alias is an abbreviation for the application initiating the connection. For instance, C++ Demo = cpp. However, you may create regular expressions, which map many applications onto one alias. For instance, the following expression groups Office applications together: 
<P>
{{{
MSACCESS|EXCEL|MSQRY32 = msoffice 
}}}
<P>
This allows you to create a single Mapping Rule, which applies in a variety of cases. If you do not employ regular expressions, you will need to create one Mapping Rule per application.
