= UDA Connect String Attributes (all mechanisms and formats) =

You may need to build a complete Connect String to access a data source.

A connect string has the following syntax (in roughly BNF format) --
{{{
connection-string ::= empty-string[;] | attribute[;] | attribute; connection-string
empty-string ::=
attribute ::= attribute-keyword=attribute-value | DRIVER=[{]attribute-value[}]
attribute-keyword ::= DSN | UID | PWD | driver-defined-attribute-keyword
attribute-value ::= character-string
driver-defined-attribute-keyword ::= identifier
}}}    
-- where --
* {{{character-string}}} has zero or more characters; 
* {{{identifier}}} has one or more characters; 
* {{{attribute-keyword}}} is not case-sensitive; 
* {{{attribute-value}}} may be case-sensitive; and 
* the value of the {{{DSN}}} keyword does not consist solely of blanks. 

The following list describes valid attributes and their possible values common to all our data access drivers and providers (Single-Tier and Multi-Tier; ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET, and OLE DB) --

* **{{{DSN}}}** &mdash; Datasource name.
* **{{{UID}}}** &mdash; Username.
* **{{{PWD}}}** &mdash; Password.
* **{{{DRIVER}}}** &mdash; Identifies the ODBC Driver to be used. This should generally be either --
#* the name displayed in the ODBC Administrator, returned by the {{{SQLDrivers()}}} function, or found in the odbcinst.ini file, wrapped in braces ("{{{{ }}}}"); or 
#* the full path to the driver library, without wrapper.
* **{{{ReadOnly}}}** &mdash; Make the session read-only.  Acceptable values are {{{Yes}}} and {{{No}}}.  {{{No}}} may be necessary to run stored procedures in some environments.
* **{{{FetchBufferSize}}}** or **{{{FBS}}}** &mdash; Integer value to determine the number of rows to buffer in each fetch.  Values range from 1 to 999.
* **{{{NoLoginBox}}}** or **{{{NLB}}}** &mdash; Suppress the authentication dialog box that will appear if either username or password have been omitted.  Acceptable values are {{{Yes}}} and {{{No}}}.
* **{{{MaxRows}}}** &mdash;  Integer value to limit the number of returned rows.
* **{{{SVAST}}}** &mdash; Present system views as if they were system tables.  Acceptable values are {{{Yes}}} and {{{No}}}.
