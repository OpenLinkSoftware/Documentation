===This application uses CTL3D32.DLL, which has not been correctly installed===


Some customers may experience this error message if they use our drivers with <nop>FileMaker Pro. The error is a result of an older version of the CTL3D32.DLL that is installed into <nop>FileMaker's directory.

The .DLL appears to have the same version number and the same file size as the one in your {{{%SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32}}} directory, but its creation date is typically much older. This version is older than the version that <nop>OpenLink's ODBC Drivers require.

To rectify the matter, please follow these steps:

1. Locate a copy of CTL3D32.DLL in your {{{C:\Windows\System32}}} directory. Ensure that this copy's creation date is in August 2001.

2. Locate the copy of CTL3D32.DLL in your <nop>FileMaker directory.

3. Rename or delete this version. This will force <nop>FileMaker to look in your {{{%SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32}}} directory for the .DLL.

4. You may need to restart your machine before these changes will be fully recognized by <nop>FileMaker.
