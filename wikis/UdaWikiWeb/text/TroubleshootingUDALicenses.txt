==License Files==

Do you have an <nop>OpenLink 4.x or newer license? If so, this is a binary file, though it may appear to be largely text, if opened in a text-editor. Values, especially numerical ones, can be misinterpreted in such a text view. <nop>OpenLink Product Support can run the license through a program called ASN Print. {{{asnprint.exe}}} returns a set number of attributes that can be used in the following way:

|**Attribute**|**Implications**|
|{{{SerialNumber}}}|Do you experience Duplicate Serial Number errors? If so, gather all licenses and compare their serial numbers. The serial numbers must not be identical. Identical serial numbers show that you are attempting to use one license on multiple machines. Contact Account Management to acquire approach licensing for your actual needs.|
|{{{RegisteredTo}}}|This parameter has no support value.|
|{{{NumberOfUsers}}}|This value represents the number of client machines that can connect simultaneously. It is useful in resolving "exceeded maximum number of licensed connections errors." If you experience this error, compare the <code><nop>NumberOfUsers</code> value to the number of client machines that can successfully connect at one time; they should match. Traces, log files, or database monitoring tools may also be needed to ascertain the true number of clients that are connected at one time.|
|{{{NumberOfConnections}}}|This value represents the number of database sessions that may be opened simultaneously. It is useful in resolving "exceeded maximum number of licensed connections errors." If you experience this error, compare the <code><nop>NumberOfConnections</code> value to the number of successfully opened database sessions. Traces, log files, <code>oplshut -s</code> output, or database monitoring tools may also be needed to ascertain the true number of sessions that are open at one time.|
|{{{NumberOfCPUs}}}|This value must match or exceed the number of physical processor cores in your machine.|
|{{{Clients}}}|Must reflect the Data Access Mechanism(s) of the client driver(s) or provider(s) -- ODBC, JDBC, OLE DB, ADO.NET, and/or XMLA.|
|{{{ExpireDate}}}|Check this parameter if you experience license expiration errors. Compare with the current date.|
|{{{Platform}}}|Check this parameter if you experience errors that suggest the license is invalid for the operating system. Compare with a <code>uname -a</code> from the actual machine.|
|{{{Availability}}}|This parameter is unlikely to play a role in most Support-related issues.  This parameter designates some licenses as OEM licenses.|
|{{{Release}}}|Check this parameter if you experience invalid license or upgrade license errors. Compare with Multi-Tier Broker and/or agent strings or Single-Tier version information.|

Note: You may open <nop>OpenLink's 1.x and 3.x licenses to obtain the same information. These old licenses are text files.

If licensing problems persist, take the following action:

# Ensure that only one correctly named license file for the product is found on the relevant machine.
# Ensure that <nop>OpenLink version 6 and later License Managers (oplmgr) are restarted.
# Ensure that Multi-Tier Request Brokers are restarted or reinitialized.
# Ensure that Single-Tier drivers and Single-Tier licenses share the same [[STProductCodes|product code]].
# As a last resort, reinstall and relicense the product. Wipe references to <nop>OpenLink products from Windows registries, where appropriate.
