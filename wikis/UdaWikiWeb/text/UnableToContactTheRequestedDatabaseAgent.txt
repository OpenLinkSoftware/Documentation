"<code>Unable to contact the requested database agent</code>" errors are generic. These messages do not provide enough information to debug the underlying problem.

Reviewing the Request Broker Log, especially if the Request Broker is running in "debug" mode, usually reveals more information.

Common causes of this error message include --

* The Broker Host has more than one IP address and/or more than one network interface (even if only one is configured).  If either of these is the case, check the Broker Rulebook and ensure that <code><nowiki>[Network TCP]:IPAddress</nowiki></code> is set to the Broker host IP address which can be reached by all clients *and* by the Broker itself.
* The Database Agent may take longer to instantiate than the <code><nowiki>[Communications]:<nop>ReceiveTimeout</nowiki></code> allows.  Try increasing this value, [[ConfiguringMTCommunicationsAttributes|being careful to follow these guidelines]].

* Request Broker Rulebook
