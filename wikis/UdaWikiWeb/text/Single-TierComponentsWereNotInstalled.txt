==Installation Specific Problems==
===Single-Tier Components Were Not Installed===

The Web installer bundles all of <nop>OpenLink's Single-Tier drivers into one archive. If the installer does not install your particular driver, take the following action: 

1. Repeat the installation.

2. Watch for the "Select Components" dialog box.

3.  Highlight "Lite ODBC Drivers 32Bit" in the "Select Components" list box. 

4. Click the "Change" button. 

5. Watch for a new list box. This list box names all of the Single-Tier drivers. 

6. Check the drivers you want.

7. Uncheck drivers that you do not want. 

8. Proceed through the rest of the install screens. 

If this method does not enable you to select your Single-Tier driver, contact <nop>OpenLink Product Support. A product consultant will provide you with a direct link to the specific product.
