The Single-Tier ODBC Drivers for Informix conform to the common architectural perceptions of an ODBC driver -- a single component installed on a desktop, workstation, or application server machine that depends on additional database specific networking middleware (from the relevant database vendor) for local or remote database connectivity. 

The [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier Drivers for Informix are a Type A class of driver developed using the Informix ESQL/C call level interface and assumes the previous installation of the Informix Connect software for the target Informix Server release. 

The Informix drivers are currently available for Informix versions 7.x and 9.x (IDS 2000) and beyond.
