===Error while trying to retrieve text for error ORA-?????, TNS-?????===

The Oracle `OCI Client` for Mac OS X is available, but must be downloaded directly from Oracle. Please note that the entire OCI Client installation is not necessary for ODBC connectivity.
    
<nop>OpenLink bundles the only necessary library, libclntsh.dylib, from the Oracle OCI Client, into our installation of the <nop>OpenLink Lite driver for Oracle on Mac OS X.
    
The Oracle Lite driver does require the user to specify the Oracle Home Directory (also known as ORACLE_HOME, or <nop>OraHome) in each DSN; it then looks within this directory for a group-writeable file, $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora. If this file does not exist, or is not group-writeable, the driver will fail to function as desired.
    
<nop>OpenLink's general recommendation is to execute the following commands in a Terminal session -
    
{{{
    
mkdir -p /Library/ODBC/Oracle/network/admin
touch
/Library/ODBC/Oracle/network/admin/tnsnames.ora
chmod -R 775 /Library/ODBC/Oracle
        
}}}

Users may also choose to add the entire OCI Client to their machine, if they prefer to receive full-text errors rather than just the `TNS-12345` style errors, which are delivered by this single library. The necessary installer may be downloaded from Oracle, via the following link (note - this will require one to register with Oracle's <nop>TechNet).
    
    
{{{
    
OCI 8 Client for Mac OS X (approx 6 MB)
          
http://download.oracle.com/otn/utilities_drivers/jdbc/8171/<nop>MacOSX_8171.cpio
        
}}}

These components may be installed anywhere on the boot volume. Oracle has a recommended location, or one may use their own preferred location. The directory which is thereafter known as ORACLE_HOME should be specified in all Oracle Lite DSNs, and the TNS Names file referenced by the <nop>OpenLink drivers should reside at $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora.
    
Installation instructions are shown on the download page for the OCI Client. They currently indicate the wrong cpio filename; this has been corrected in the instructions which follow.
    
<nop>OpenLink recommends first creating a directory, /Library/ODBC/Oracle/, and placing the MacOSX_8171.cpio file therein. Then execute these commands to shift to the bash shell, and unpack the cpio file -
    
    
{{{
    
bash
cpio -idvmc < MacOSX_8171.cpio
        
}}}

The user will observe output similar to that below, and the listed zip files will now be found in /Library/ODBC/Oracle/ (or whatever location was chosen above) -
    
    
{{{
    
bash-2.05a$ cpio -idvmc < MacOSX_8171.cpio
./MacOSX_8.1.7.1_OCI_Demo.zip
./Oracle_8.1.7.1_Client.zip
./Release_Notes.zip
1176 blocks
bash-2.05a$
        
}}}

The following instructions are adapted from the contents of the Release_Notes.zip.
    
Installation Instructions
    
 The following procedures provide the instructions to install the Oracle8i Client software. The examples shown assume that the directory used is /Library/ODBC/Oracle and commands are entered in the bash shell.
    
       
* Copy the Oracle_8.1.7.1_Client.zipfile to a directory on the local disk drive. For example,

{{{
    
% cp Oracle_8.1.7.1_Client.zip
/Library/ODBC/Oracle
            
}}}
    
* Change to the directory designated in Step 1, and extract the contents of the zip file. Several new directories will be created as a result of the extraction process. For example:

{{{
    
              % cd /Library/ODBC/Oracle
              % unzip Oracle_8.1.7.1_Client.zip
            
}}}
     
* Set theORACLE_HOME environment variable. For example,

{{{
    
              % export
              ORACLE_HOME=/Library/ODBC/Oracle/
            
}}}
     
* Users who are using the <nop>OpenLink driver for connectivity, and no other OCI-dependent products, may skip to Step 9.

   
* Set theDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the library location. For example,
{{{
    
              % export
              DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib
            
}}}

  NOTE: User applications that are developed using Oracle Call Interface (OCI) must be linked with this shared client library.

   
* Set theORA_NLS33environment variable to point to the$ORACLE_HOME/ocommon/nls/admin/datadirectory which contains the Oracle NLS message files. For example:

{{{
    
              % export
              ORA_NLS33=$ORACLE_HOME/ocommon/nls/admin/data
            
}}}
     
* Set theTNS_ADMINenvironment variable to point to the location of the tnsnames.ora network configuration file.

{{{
    
              % export
              TNS_ADMIN=$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin
            
}}}
     
* Modify thet nsnames.orafile to use the alias for an address that the listener is listening for a database from a remote host.
   
* Replace net_service_name with the actual net service name of the remote database.
   
* Replace hostname with the actual remote host name.
   
* Replace1521with the actual port number.

* Replace oracle_sid with the Oracle8i database's service name. This is usually the global database name specified in the init.orafile on the remote server.

* Launch the <nop>OpenLink ODBC Administrator (/Applications/Utilities/), and configure a DSN, by following the instructions in the <nop>OpenLink documentation.

* Test.
