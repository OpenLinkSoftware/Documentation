%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements ==

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target Microsoft SQL Server DBMS instance and database:

* [[HowDoIFindMySQLServerInstanceName|Microsoft SQL Server instance name]]
* [[HowDoIFindMySQLServerListenPort|Microsoft SQL Server listen port]]
* Microsoft SQL Server database name
* MIcrosoft SQL Server database server hostname or IP address

== Software Requirements ==

*  There are no software requirements associated with use of the Multi-Tier "Enterprise" Edition Request Broker and Database Agent(s) for Microsoft SQL Server.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are already in use on the Broker host. These ports are the defaults used by our Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. If other services are using these, you will need to assign different (unused) ports to the new services during installation.
