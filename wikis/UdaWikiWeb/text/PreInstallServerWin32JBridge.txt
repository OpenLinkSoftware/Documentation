= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources (a/k/a, the ODBC/JDBC/ADO.NET-to-JDBC Bridge), for Windows =

%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements ==

* Your target data source must be SQL compliant.
* You must have all information necessary to configure a JDBC connection to the data source.

== Software Requirements ==

* You must possess **third-party or native JDBC drivers** that connect to your target data source. A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources.
* Your Windows environment must be configured to enable connections using the intended JDBC driver. <nop>OpenLink Product Support can provide minimal assistance in this area.  
#* Particularly, the full path to the JDBC driver {{{.jar}}} file must be included in your {{{%CLASSPATH%}}} Environment Variable. To do this, proceed as follows --
#*# Locate the JDBC DRiver {{{.jar}}} file, and make note of the the full path to that file.
#*# **Start** -> **Control Panel** -> **System**
#*# Click to the **Advanced** tab.
#*# Click the **Environment Variables** button.
#*# In the "System variables" pane, locate and select the environment variable named "CLASSPATH" .
#*# Click **Edit** which will bring up a new dialog containing **Variable name** and **Variable value** fields.
#*# Add the full file path from step #1 to the **start** of the already present "Variable value" field, taking care not to delete anything that is already present.  Directory paths are separated by a semi-colon ';', so you should usually put a semicolon after the path you're adding.  Typically, the new text will resemble --
{{{
C:\Program Files\JDBC for DBMS\lib\driver.jar;
}}}
#*# Finally, click **OK** to accept the changes.
#* Supporting Java libraries (or links to them) may also need to be included in this variable value.
#* Directories containing other supporting libraries may need to be included in one of the other shared library environment variables (e.g., {{{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}}, {{{LIBPATH}}}, {{{SHLIB_PATH}}}).
* If using a 64-bit JDBC Driver, you must have the 64-bit Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources.
* You must have a **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** that is compatible with the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources. 
#* Generally, the latest JVM from http://java.com/ is the best choice.
#* If using a 64-bit JDBC Driver, you must have a 64-bit JVM, which is only presented to 64-bit IE.
* The path to the directory containing the {{{jvm.dll}}} must be included in your {{{%PATH%}}} Environment Variable. To do this, proceed as follows --
*# Use the Windows Explorer's **Search** feature to locate the {{{jvm.dll}}}, and make note of the directory in which it is found.  If more than one is found, work with the most recent.
*# **Start** -> **Control Panel** -> **System**
*# Click to the **Advanced** tab.
*# Click the **Environment Variables** button.
*# In the "System variables" pane, locate and select the environment variable named "PATH" .
*# Click **Edit** which will bring up a new dialog containing **Variable name** and **Variable value** fields.
*# Add the directory path from step #1 to the **end** of the already present "Variable value" field, taking care not to delete anything that is already present.  Directory paths are separated by a semi-colon ';', so you should usually put a semicolon before the path you're adding.  Typically, the new text will resemble --
{{{
;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_03\bin\client
}}}
*# Finally, click **OK** to accept the changes.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* The Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources must be installed on the same machine as the JDBC drivers that connect to the target database.
* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are already in use on the Broker host. These ports are the defaults used by our Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. If other services are using these, you will need to assign different (unused) ports to the new services during installation.
* For best results, the Enterprise Edition server components should be installed while logged in as the owner of the local third-party JDBC driver.
* All JDBC-related environment variables should be set prior to installation. This is typically accomplished simply by logging in as the owner of the local third-party JDBC driver.
* You must know the driver class name of your JDBC driver.
* You must know the full details of the JDBC connection URL that connects to your target JDBC Data Source.
