Use the following guidelines to prevent stability problems: 

*Patch databases and operating systems regularly.  
*Contact database and o/s vendors to see if patches are associated with problems.  
*Ensure Unix kernel tuning parameters match parameters specified by database and o/s documentation.  
*Ensure your machine has adequate memory and processor resources.  
*Comparison test Multi-Tier drivers when Single-Tier drivers appear to expose limitations in a database native client.  
*Re-link Multi-Tier database agents against databases, especially patched databases.  
*Ensure [[PortHigh]]  is set in the [Protocol TCP] section of the Multi-Tier Session Rules Book. This is the oplrqb.ini file that resides in the /bin sub-directory of the server components installation.  
Multi-Tier users perform the following test: 

*login to the machine that contains the [[OpenLink]]  server components.  
*Run oplshut -s on the command-line.  
*Compare the output to the Windows (Task Manager) or Unix (ps -ef.)  
*Upgrade server components if oplshut shows fewer processes when compared to the Task Manager or ps.  
Multi-Tier users experiment with database agent reuse. Users should comparison test the following values: 

*ifsame process, upto 5  
*ifsame application, upto 5  
*ifsame database, upto 5
