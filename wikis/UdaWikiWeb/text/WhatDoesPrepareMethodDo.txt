= What does Prepare Method ({{{SPOption}}}) do? =

This option is specific to the TDS-based Driver for Microsoft SQL Server & Sybase ASE/ASA. It determines whether the driver creates stored procedures on the server for {{{SQLPrepare()}}} calls.

|  *GUI Setting*  |  *Options Setting*  |  *Effect*  |
|  Full  |  <code>-O 2</code>  | Stored procedures are created for every call to <code>SQLPrepare()</code>. This can result in decreased performance when processing statements that do not contain parameters.  |
|  Partial  |  <code>-O 1</code>  | //**Default.**//  Stored procedures are created if the statement contains parameters. Otherwise, the statement is cached by the driver and run directly at the time of <code>SQLExecute()</code>.  |
|  None  |  <code>-O 0</code>  | Stored procedures are never created. The driver caches the statement, executes it directly at the time of <code>SQLExecute()</code>, and reports any syntax or similar errors at the time of <code>SQLExecute()</code>.  |
