===Relinking Server Agents===

It is sometimes necessary to link or re-link your <nop>OpenLink database agents.  Typical reasons include:

* No database agent executable was supplied with the <nop>OpenLink server components installed on your OpenLink server machine.
* A database agent executable file exists but is unable to converse with your database server due to version incompatibility.

<nop>OpenLink provides a database agent relink script for each supported database engine. These scripts are named using the following convention:

*  {{{ld}}} - indicates a link script
*  {{{XXX}}} - first three letters (perhaps 4) of database name
* {{{NN}}} - major and perhaps minor release number
* {{{mv}}} - If the agent is multi-threaded

Examples: {{{ldora81mv}}} is a multi-threaded agent for Oracle 8i. {{{ldoig2}}} is a single-threaded agent for Ingres II.
