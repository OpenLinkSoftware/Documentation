= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Database Agent(s) for DB2, for Windows =

%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements ==

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target DB2 DBMS instance and database:

* [[HowDoIIdentifyDB2DatabaseNames|Database Name]]
* [[HowDoIIdentifyTheDB2InstanceName|DB2 Instance Name]]
* Database Server Hostname or IP Address

== Software Requirements ==

*  You will need an installation of the DB2 native client on a supported operating system, if you cannot install the Enterprise Edition server components on the same machine as DB2. At the time of writing, this product is called <b><i>DB2 Connect.</i></b> Product names may vary over time.
* You must know whether the local DB2 components are 32-bit or 64-bit. The Enterprise Edition server components must match the bit format of the local DB2 components, not the OS.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* The Request Broker and database-specific Agents must be installed on the same machine as DB2 or a  DB2 native client. If you install on the same machine as the DB2 native client, you must have a [[ConfigureDB2DBAliasonUnix|DB2 database alias]] configured.
* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are already in use on the Broker host. These ports are the defaults used by our Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. If other services are using these, you will need to assign different (unused) ports to the new services during installation.
* For best results, the Enterprise Edition server components should be installed while logged in as the local DB2 or DB2 native client owner.
* All DB2-related environment variables should be set prior to installation. This is typically accomplished simply by logging in as the local DB2 or DB2 native client owner.
