<p><nop>InstallShield makes it possible</p>

<p>article based on [[http://support.mobileautomation.com/support/tsarticle.asp?tsid=277]]</p>

<h3>Issue:</h3>
<p>Any application can easily be made into an unattended and silent installation if it's setup install program is based on '<nop>InstallShield'.  <nop>InstallShield is an industry standard installation packaging system for initially installing many programs.</p>

<p>To do this you would use a built in function of <nopInstallshield which allows you to create an answer file (ISS).  This file would be create by walking through a real installation on a test PC and literally remembering all the selections you make as you go through the install.  These settings would then be saved to an answer file (<code>setup.iss</code>) which is created by default in the WINNT or Windows directory.</p>

<p>You can then re-execute the setup.exe installation by simply pointing to the setup.iss answer file as an option.  <nop>InstallShield will silently walk through the installation using all of your saved options and settings.</p>

<p>It is also possible to perform a silent uninstall using a similar trick.</p>

<p>Use the following command line options to accomplish this task.</p>


<h3>Resolution:</h3>
<p>Install shield options</p>

<blockquote><p><code>setup.exe -r</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will create answer file</p>

<p><code>setup.exe -s -a /s /f1setup.iss</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will execute the silent install</p>

<p><code>setup.iss</code> will be created in the Winnt directory<p></blockquote>

<h3>To Uninstall</h3>

<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote><code>"C:\WINDOWS\ISUNINST.EXE" -y -a -m -f "C:\Program Files\Path To\DeIsL1.isu"</code></blockquote>

<p>You will need to adjust the path of the ISU file for your particular application.</p>
