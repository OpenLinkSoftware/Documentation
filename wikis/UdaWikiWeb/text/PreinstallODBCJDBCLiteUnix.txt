= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for JDBC Data Sources (a/k/a the ODBC-JDBC Bridge), for Unix-like OS =

%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements ==

* Your target data source must be SQL compliant. 
* You must possess enough knowledge to establish a JDBC connection to this database using third-party or native JDBC drivers. 

== Software Requirements ==

* You must possess **third-party or native JDBC drivers** that connect to your target data source. A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for JDBC Data Sources.
* The JDBC driver jar file (or a symbolic link to it) must be included in the active {{{CLASSPATH}}}. 
#* Supporting Java libraries (or links to them) may also need to be included in this variable value.
#* Directories containing other supporting libraries may need to be included in one of the other shared library environment variables (e.g., {{{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}}, {{{LIBPATH}}}, {{{SHLIB_PATH}}}).
* You must have a **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** that is compatible with the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for JDBC Data Sources. 
#* Generally, the latest JVM from http://java.com/ is the best choice.
#* If using a 64-bit ODBC Driver, you must have a 64-bit JVM.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* You must be able to connect to the target database using the JDBC driver. <nop>OpenLink Product Support can provide minimal assistance in this area.
* You must know the **driver class name** of the JDBC driver.
* You must know the full details of the **JDBC connection URL** that connects to your target database.
