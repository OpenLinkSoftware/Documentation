= Error Message: {{{Cannot bind to socket (Address already in use)}}} =

These errors are typically associated with the Request Broker's HTTP-based Admin Assistant. If you receive "Cannot bind to socket" errors, run the following command:

 <blockquote><code><nowiki>netstat -a | grep &lt;Admin_Assistant_port_number&gt;</nowiki></code></blockquote>

For example:

 <blockquote><code><nowiki>netstat -a | grep 8000</nowiki></code></blockquote>

If the port is busy, take the following action:
# Access the machine on which you want to host the Admin Assistant (i.e., the Broker host).
# Use a text editor to open {{{www_sv.ini}}}, typically found in the {{{/bin/w3config}}} sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink installation.
# Locate the {{{[Startup]}}} stanza. For example:
{{{
[Startup]
HttpPort = 8000
HttpRoot = html
Timeout = 60
TclInclude = include
ScriptDirectories = /scripts
CGIDirectories = /cgi-bin
IndexPage = /index.html
}}}
# Set {{{HttpPort}}} to a different, unused TCP port. For example:
{{{
HttpPort = 8001
}}}
# Save your changes and exit the file.
# Restart or reinitialize your Request Broker.
# Test.
