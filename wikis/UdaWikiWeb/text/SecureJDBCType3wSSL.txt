The Java JDBC classes make use of J2SSE from Sun: as such, SSL is not supported with users of JDK1.1; it requires a separate download from Sun for JDK1.2 and 1.3; and these classes come as standard with JDK 1.4 and 1.5.

An SSL connection can be made by specifying the /<nop>UseSSL attribute in your JDBC connectstring, thus:

{{{
jdbc:openlink://localhost:5001/SVT=SQLServer/Database=pubs/UseSSL/UID=sa/PWD=
java -classpath .;.\opljdbc3.jar -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<KeystoreFile> sample
}}}

where 'sample' is the name the JDBC Program. Note the use of the keystore file which is a unique feature of the JSSE implmentation, being the location where the certificate information is stored.

Should the JSSE classes not be located the JDBC client will return an error of the form:

{{{
"You need to add JSSE to your CLASSPATH in order to make a SSL connection
java.sql.SQLException: [OpenLink][OPLJDBC2]Connection failed:
java.io.IOException: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:javax/net/ssl/SSLSocket"
}}}
