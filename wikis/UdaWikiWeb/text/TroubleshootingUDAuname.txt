===uname -a output===


The {{uname -a}} command produces the following output: 

* Operating System Name 
* Node Name 
* Operating System Release 
* Operating System Version 
* Hardware Name/Class 
* Processor Type %
* Hardware Implementation 

For example: 

{{{
bash-2.03$ uname -a
SunOS solserver 5.8 Generic_108528-22 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60
}}}

You should compare the {{{uname -a}}} output with version strings produced by <nop>OpenLink's Database Agents, Request Brokers, or other products. Specifically, compare the {{{uname -a}}} output with the version string "Compiled for" entry. The "Compiled for" entry contains the following information: 

* Operating System
* Operating System Version
* Processor Type
* Operating System Vendor
* 32 or 64 Bit Operating System Designation

For example: 

{{{
Compiled for Solaris 5.8 (sparc-sun-solaris2.8-32)
}}}

In so doing, look for discrepancies that signal operating system and <nop>OpenLink component incompatibility.

Note that some platforms require use of different options to get full OS version information.  For instance, SCO OpenServer 5 only reveals sub-versions through {{{uname -X}}}.
