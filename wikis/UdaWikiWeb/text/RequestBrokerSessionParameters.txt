=Request Broker Session Parameters=

The Request Broker is responsible for setting up the profile of one of more <nop>OpenLink Data Access sessions, this includes a Transport Protocol selection, Keep Alive Packets notifications, Network Message Buffer Sizes. Initialization retry intervals, Agent initialization timeouts, and much more. Rather than have you manually set this options via the <nop>OpenLink Rule Book, it is now possible for you to configure this options via your Web Browser of choice using the Admin Assitant

The Admin assistant allows you to configure Request Broker session parameters in two ways, via a series of Wizard Interactions or via an HTML form, the sections that follow illustrate both approaches.
