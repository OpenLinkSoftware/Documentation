= Configuring Linked Servers in Microsoft SQL Server 2005-2012, using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers =

The following steps are appropriate (with minimal adjustment) for Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and later.

# Log in to the machine that hosts the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 instance.
# In the **Start** menu, drill down to **Programs** -> **Microsoft SQL Server 2005** (or similar) -> **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**.
# Locate your Microsoft SQL Server instance, and drill down to **Server Objects** -> **Linked Servers**.
# Right-click on **Linked Servers**, and select **New Linked Server**.
# Supply the following information on the **General** tab:
#* **Linked Server:** //Any name you like//
#* (Check **Other Data Source**)
#* **Provider Name:** Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers
#* **Product Name:** MSDASQL
#* **Data Source:** //Valid ODBC DSN Name//
#* //**Note:** <nop>OpenLink ODBC DSNs do not store username and password data, so these should be set in the **Security** tab, below.//
# This is the minimum information which you must supply. **Provider Name** and **Product Name** must be exactly as shown above.  Feel free to engage any server options on the bottom of the tab.
# If your ODBC Data Sources requires Username and Password authentication, click to the **Security** tab and review your options.  This is the only way to provide user credentials to the ODBC connection.
# Click **OK** to create your server.
# Exit the Linked Server dialog box, and the Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Manager.
# Open the **Microsoft SQL Server Query Analyzer**.
# Run a query similar to the following, to test your Linked Server:
{{{
select * from OPENQUERY (Your_LINKEDSERVER_Name, 'your SQL query here')
}}}
