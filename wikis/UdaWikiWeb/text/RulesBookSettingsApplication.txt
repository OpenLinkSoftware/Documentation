===[Application Aliases]===

This section will replace the application name with an internal alias. This alias is used in the sixth colon delimited field of a mapping rule.

This example would match MSACCESS (a program requiring the Jet option), and map it to an alias of jet. The second alias mapping would match various Office applications and convert them to a single alias.
 
{{{
[Application Aliases]
MSACCESS           = jet
MSQRY.*|EXCEL|WORD = msoffice
}}}
