= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for ODBC Data Sources (a/k/a, the ODBC/JDBC/ADO.NET-to-ODBC Bridge), for Windows =

%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements ==

* Your target data source must be SQL compliant.
* You must have all information necessary to configure an ODBC connection to the data source.

== Software Requirements ==

* You must possess **third-party or native ODBC drivers** that connect to your target data source. A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for ODBC Data Sources.
* You must know whether the local ODBC components are 32-bit or 64-bit. The Enterprise Edition server components must match the bit format of the local ODBC components, not the OS.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* The Bridge Agent(s) for ODBC Data Sources must be installed on the same machine as the ODBC driver that connects to the target data source.
* A System DSN based on the local ODBC driver should be pre-configured and tested to successfully connect to the target data source.
* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are already in use on the Broker host. These ports are the defaults used by our Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. If other services are using these, you will need to assign different (unused) ports to the new services during installation.
* For best results, the Enterprise Edition server components should be installed while logged in as the owner of the local ODBC driver.
* All ODBC-related environment variables should be set prior to installation. This is typically accomplished simply by logging in as the owner of the local ODBC driver.
