<nop>OpenLink Product Support does not have detailed information pertaining to the analysis of code. <nop>OpenLink recommends that you test simple connection code in a suitable environment before proceeding to write advanced code that performs queries. This serves as a "sanity check" and is more apt to quickly expose non-code problems that stem from misconfigured drivers. 

Once you have connection code, write code that performs simple select statements. Then, write code that performs increasingly complex queries. <nop>OpenLink Product Support can try to assist you along the way. However, code review is the proper domain of Professional Services, and it is a premium (i.e., billable) service.
