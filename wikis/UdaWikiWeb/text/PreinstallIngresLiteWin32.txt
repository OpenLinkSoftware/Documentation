%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements==

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target Ingres node and database:

* [[HowCanIFindMyIngresNodeName|The Ingres node name]] 
* [[HowCanIFindMyIngresListenAddress|The Ingres listen address]] 
* The Ingres database name

== Software Requirements ==

* You need to know whether the client application is 32-bit or 64-bit. The Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for Ingres must match the bit format of the client application.
* The version-specific Ingres native client or Ingres itself must be installed on the same host as the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for Ingres.
#* The Ingres II native client may be found on the Ingres install media. 
#* The Ingres 3 client is part of the Open Source download kit. At the time of writing, many platforms for which Ingres 3 is available were not supplied with pre-compiled library binaries.
#* The local Ingres components must match the bit format of the client application and the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for Ingres.

== Configuration Requirements ==
