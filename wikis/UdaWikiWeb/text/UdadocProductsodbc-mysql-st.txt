The Single-Tier ODBC Drivers for [[MySQL]]  conform to the common architectural perceptions of an ODBC driver -- a single component installed on a desktop, workstation, or application server machine. 

The [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier Drivers for [[MySQL]]  are a Type B class of driver developed using the [[MySQL]]  network (wire) protocol interface eliminating the need for the installation of any [[MySQL]]  specific client networking software. 

The drivers are currently available for [[MySQL]]  versions 3.x, 4.x and beyond.
