= Error Message: {{{The shared memory is version <number>; expected <number> (1178)}}} =

If you receive shared memory version errors, you have two options --

* Switch to [[ServerAgentAdminProgress|sockets-based connections]] (recommended for most situations)%BR%%BR%
* [[RelinkMulti-TierDatabaseAgents|Relink your database agent]], for which you must have
#* set and exported {{{DLC}}} and {{{PROLOAD}}} environment variables. 
##* {{{DLC}}} points to the root of the Progress installation. 
##* {{{PROLOAD}}} points to the {{{$DLC/probuild/}}} directory
#* a {{{$DLC/probuild/4gl/}}} directory, which requires a development license from Progress
#* an HLI/C license, obtained from Progress (only required for Progress 6; later versions do not have this requirement)
