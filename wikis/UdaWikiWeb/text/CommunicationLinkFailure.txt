= UDA Error Message: {{{Communication link failure}}} with SQL state {{{08S01}}} =

This error is very generic, and may stem from a number of causes.

Look for an underlying cause in Debug-level logs from the Request Broker if using Multi-Tier, and mechanism-specific traces and/or driver debug logs for all client-side drivers (Multi-Tier Generic Client, or any Lite or Express Edition driver).
