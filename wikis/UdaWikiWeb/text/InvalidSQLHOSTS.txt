=Invalid SQLHOSTS=

* When using Multi-Tier drivers, "invalid sqlhosts" errors may indicate that your Database Agent was built against a version of Informix which did not support <code>SQLHOSTS</code> server group entries. To remedy this problem, pursue the following options:
## Create a separate <code>sqlhosts</code> file, e.g., <code><nowiki>sqlhosts2</nowiki></code>. (This second sqlhosts file cannot contain server group entries.) Then, set the <code>INFORMIXSQLHOSTS</code> environment variable to point to this new file. For example:
{{{
export INFORMIXSQLHOSTS=/dbs/informix/32bit/7.3/etc/sqlhosts2
}}}
## Relink your database agent. This may enable your agent to work with the existing <code>sqlhosts</code> file.
* If you are using a Single-Tier driver, the <code><nowiki>$INFORMIXDIR/etc/sqlhosts</nowiki></code> file (or the sqlhosts information in the Windows registry) should be checked, to confirm that all data therein is correct and contains supported values. 
* If you are working with IBM Informix Dynamic Server, IBM Informix Universal Server, or IBM Informix OnLine Dynamic Server, also check the <code>DBSERVERNAME</code>, <code>DBSERVERALIASES</code>, and <code>NETTYPE</code> parameters in the <code>$ONCONFIG</code> configuration file or within the <code>informixserver</code> entries in the registry. 
* If you are working with IBM Informix SE, check the <code>dbservername</code>, <code>nettype</code>, <code>hostname</code>, and <code>servicename</code> fields in the <code>sqlhosts</code> file to make sure that you have entered the correct values.
* For additional information, refer to your Informix Administrator's Guide.
