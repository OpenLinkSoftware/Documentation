= Installing the <nop>OpenLink Single-Tier Tabular XMLA Provider, for Windows=

==What is It ?==

The <nop>OpenLink Single-Tier Tabular XMLA Provider is a hybrid bridge to ODBC and OLE DB, enabling transparent access to any ODBC- or OLE DB-accessible data store, as indicated in the architectural diagram below:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/AjaxDBConnectivity.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%

The <nop>OpenLink AJAX Toolkit (OAT) is a Javascript library which enables the development of database-independent rich internet applications. 

OAT includes the <nop>OpenLink AJAX Database Connectivity (ADBC) interface, a generic data access API for Javascript that provides transparent access to SQL (via XMLA), RDF (via SPARQL), XML (via HTTP), Web Services (SOAP or REST variants over HTTP), and Free Text (via GData) data. Query results are delivered as JSON or XML, and support for XSLT and XPath/XQuery are built in, should additional local post-processing be required. Below is an architectural diagram for the <nop>OpenLink Ajax Database Connectivity API:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/oat2.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%

A lightweight standalone Web Server is also included for hosting the OAT and XMLA Provider applications or services. IIS (or any other web server) can also be used as the host.

==How do I Use It ?==

===Configuration and Testing===

# Assuming the Form Designer application was started during the installation phase, the application loads and prompts for the username, password, and web server type to be used for the session; accept the defaults to continue.

Other sample OAT applications available from the '<nop>OpenLink Ajax Toolkit' start menu item which include the OAT 'Query by Exmaple' and 'SQL Designer' applications ...

===IIS Configuration===

The OAT and XMLA Provider can be configured for use with IIS on Windows as detailed below, enabling XMLA applications to be written using the <nop>OpenLink  XMLA provider that are hosted on IIS.

//**Note** configuration and testing with IIS v7 is currently in progress ...  We expect it to work fine, but cannot provide specific guidance yet.//

The following steps will work for IIS v6.

# Run the "Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager" program from Control Panel -> Administrative Tools%BR%%BR%
# Created an IIS Virtual Directories called /DAV with the physical directory pointing to C:\Program Files\<nop>OpenLink Software\OAT\DAV  (or where ever the XMLA Provider was installed)%BR%%BR%
# Created an IIS Application domain called /Xmla, with physical directory pointing to C:\Program Files\<nop>OpenLink Software\OAT\Xmla  (or where ever the XMLA Provider was installed) containing the web.config file
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/xmla-32.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Enable ASP.Net 2.0 support for Web Server instance to be used for hosting
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/xmla-34.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Enable the IIS WebDAV Web Service extension%BR%%BR%
# Enable ASP.Net 2.0 support for the Web Service extension. Note if ASP.Net 2.0 was installed before IIS you will need to install the ASP.Net 2.0 module of IIS with the following command
{{{
C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_regiis.exe -i
}}}
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/xmla-33.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Ensure the file C:\Program Files\<nop>OpenLink Software\OAT\Xmla\App_data\datasources.xml is writable by the internal user IIS runs as. This is required to enable XMLA Provider Datasources created to be saved to the file via IIS.%BR%%BR%

Once IIS is configured,  accessing  the OAT sample applications can be achieved as described with the Stand alone Web Server bundled with the XMLA Provider using IIS instead.
