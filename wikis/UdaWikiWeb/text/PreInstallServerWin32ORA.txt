%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements ==

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target Oracle DBMS instance and database:

* [[HowDoIFindMyOracleSID|Oracle SID]]
* [[HowDoIFindMyOracleTCPPort|Oracle TCP Port]]
* [[HowDoIFindMySQLNetOrNetServiceName|Oracle SQL*Net or Net Service Name]] //**Only required when the Enterprise Edition server components are not installed on the Oracle server.**//
* Hostname or IP adddress of Oracle database server

== Software Requirements ==

*  You will need an installation of the Oracle native client on a supported operating system, if you cannot install the Enterprise Edition server components on the same machine as Oracle itself. At the time of writing, this product may be called SQL*Net, Net 8, Net 9, Net 10, the Oracle Instant Client, or the OCI Client, depending on the Oracle version. Product names vary over time.
* You must know whether the local Oracle components are 32-bit or 64-bit. The Enterprise Edition server components must match the bit format of the local Oracle components, not the OS.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* The Request Broker and database-specific Agents must be installed on the same machine as Oracle or an Oracle native client. If you install on the same machine as Oracle SQL*Net or Net 8/9/10/11, you need an [[CreateOracleNetServiceNameUnix|Oracle Net Service Name]] configured.
* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are already in use on the Broker host. These ports are the defaults used by our Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. If other services are using these, you will need to assign different (unused) ports to the new services during installation.
* For best results, the Enterprise Edition server components should be installed while logged in as the local Oracle or Oracle native client owner.
* All Oracle-related environment variables should be set prior to installation. This is typically accomplished simply by logging in as the local Oracle or Oracle native client owner.
