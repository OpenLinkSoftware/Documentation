== Configuration ==

JDBC client applications always require users to provide the Driver Class Name and Connection URL. 

* **Driver Class Name** -- {{{openlink.jdbc.Driver}}}, {{{openlink.jdbc2.Driver}}}, or {{{openlink.jdbc3.Driver}}}, depending on active JVM.  See [[http://docs.openlinksw.com/uda/st/opljava.html|detailed documentation]].
* **Connection URL** -- See [[JDBC1ConnectionURLFormat|detailed documentation]] to construct your local URL, which will be of the form -- 
{{{
jdbc:openlink://ODBC[/DSN=dsn][/UID=uid][/PWD=pwd][/READONLY=x]
}}}
For example, 
{{{
jdbc:openlink://ODBC/DSN=MyOracleDSN/UID=scott/PWD=tiger
}}}
#* **/DSN** -- Local ODBC Data Source Name
#* **/UID** -- Database Username
#* **/PWD** -- Database Password
#* **/READONLY** -- Read-write or read-only session mode.  Values are "Y" or "N".  Default is "N", and this is the effect if unset; i.e., a read-write connection. 

Sometimes the JDBC client applications also requires the Driver File Name and/or the path to it.  Mac OS X uses {{{/Library/Java/Extensions/}}} as its default {{{CLASSPATH}}}.  All JDBC drivers (or aliases or symbolic links to them) should be installed here, and this is what our installer does.  The Driver File Name depends on the active JVM -- {{{opljdbc.jar}}}, {{{opljdbc2.jar}}}, or {{{opljdbc3.jar}}}.  See [[http://docs.openlinksw.com/st/opljava.html|detailed documentation]].

No further system configuration should be needed.
