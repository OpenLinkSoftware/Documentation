%TOC%

   
The Jet Engine is synonymous with Microsoft tools such as Access, Excel ( [[http://www.microsoft.com/office)]]  or when developing with DAO (Data Access Objects), ( [[http://www.microsoft.com/data).]]  If your application falls into any of those categories, it is recommended that +jetfix is selected. 

This option will map Microsoft Jet data types to compatible SQL Types ready for ODBC and data access. For example, the MSAccess Data Type `Money` will be converted to Float or Decimal. This is because not all databases support this type. 

For more details on how data-types are mapped, please refer to [[http://www.openlinksw.com/info/docs/uda50/lite/appendix.html]]
