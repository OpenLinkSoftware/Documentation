= Error Message: {{{Invalid environment}}} =

"Invalid environment" generally occurs when a Multi-Tier Rulebook (default, {{{oplrqb.ini}}}) or Single-Tier {{{$OPENLINKINI}}} (default, {{{openlink.ini}}}) file is misconfigured. 

For instance, a database agent configuration section may pass an invalid name to the {{{Environment}}} parameter.

Here is a sample database agent configuration section:
{{{
[generic_pgr7]
Description = Default settings for PostgreSQL agent
Program = pgr7_mv.exe
Environment = POSTGRES7
ReUse = always
}}}

Here is a sample environment section:
{{{
[Environment POSTGRES]
;ODBC_CATALOGS = Y ; Uncomment after loading odbccat defs
CURSOR_SENSITIVITY = LOW ; Set to HIGH after loading oplrvc.sql
}}}

"Invalid environment" will occur because the database agent section passes {{{Environment = POSTGRES7}}}, and there is no {{{[Environment POSTGRES7]}}}. 

To resolve the error, simply ensure that the {{{Environment = POSTGRES7}}} and {{{[Environment POSTGRES7]}}} names match (i.e., either change {{{[Environment POSTGRES]}}} to {{{[Environment POSTGRES7]}}}, or change {{{Environment = POSTGRES7}}} to {{{Environment = POSTGRES}}}).  

Similar errors may be found in Single-Tier configuration, generally within the {{{$OPENLINKINI}}} file, and occasionally involving cros-referencing settings found in {{{$ODBCINI}}} and/or {{{$ODBCINSTINI}}}.
