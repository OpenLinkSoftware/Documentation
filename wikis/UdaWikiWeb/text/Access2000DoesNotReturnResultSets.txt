===Access 2000 Does Not Return Result Sets===

Certain MDAC 2.1 builds possess a bug. This bug is exposed by Access 2000. Specifically, Access 2000 appears to run queries. However, no result set and no error messages are returned to the application. Furthermore, no information is written to file when ODBC client side tracing is enabled. The same queries function normally with Access '97. 

If you experience this MDAC 2.1 bug, download the latest MDAC components from the following site:

Be advised -- If you upgrade your MDAC components, upgrade your Jet Engine Components. This insures component compatibility.
