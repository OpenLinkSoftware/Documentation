====The Configuration Files====

The iODBC library searches for Data Source Names (DSNs) using the following resources:

* $ODBCINI - the environment variable, if set
* ~/.odbc.ini - in your home-directory, if it exists
* /etc/odbc.ini - a system-wide default

The format of the odbc.ini file is very simple. There are 3 sections; one for ODBC itself, one for a list of DSNs, and one for the definitions of those DSNs. For example:

{{{
[ODBC]
Debug         = 1
Trace         = 0
DebugFile     = /home/tim/temp/odbc-debugfile.log
TraceFile     = /home/tim/temp/odbc-tracefile.log
TraceAutoStop = 1

[ODBC Data Sources]
Virtuoso30 = OpenLink Virtuoso 3.0

[Virtuoso30]
Description = Virtuoso 3.0
Driver      = /opt/opl/virtuoso-o12/lib/virtodbc.so
Address     = localhost:1111
UserName    = dba
User        = dba
}}}

Each DSN has an entry in the `ODBC Data Sources' section and a complete definition in a paragraph section of its own.

There is also an ODBCINSTINI file. This file provides the full path to any installed drivers and any setup files associated with them.

{{{
[ODBC Drivers]
OpenLink Generic = installed

[OpenLink Generic]
Driver = /opt/openlink/odbcsdk/lib/oplodbc.so
