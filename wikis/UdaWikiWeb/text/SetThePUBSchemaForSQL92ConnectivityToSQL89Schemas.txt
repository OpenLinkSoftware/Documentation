= Targeting the PUB schema through DSN connection attributes =

When using SQL-92 drivers for Progress, you may find that queries using single-element identifiers which worked fine with the SQL-89 drivers, e.g., --
{{{
SELECT * FROM tablename
}}}
-- now require use of the {{{PUB}}} owner identifier, e.g., --
{{{
SELECT * FROM PUB.tablename
}}}

This is due to a number of changes in the underlying Progress layers, from SQL-89 to SQL-92.

== Solution ==

This can generally be worked around by using our "**Initial SQL**" option.

This solution removes the need to prefix identifiers in new queries with "{{{PUB.}}}", but any queries which already include the prefix should continue to work just fine.

Simply create a text file, e.g., {{{openlink.sql}}}, containing the following line --
{{{
SET SCHEMA 'PUB';
}}}

<i><b>Note: </b>In some environments, varying with the precise version of the Progress and <nop>OpenLink components in use, the trailing semicolon may need to be removed, changing the file content to --</i>
{{{
SET SCHEMA 'PUB'
}}}


=== Single-Tier "Lite" Edition Setup ===

Set the "**Initial SQL**" field of your DSN to the full path to the file created above, including its file extension (e.g., {{{/opt/openlink/bin/openlink.sql}}}, {{{C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin\openlink.sql}}}, {{{/Library/Application Support/openlink/bin/openlink.sql}}}). 

On Windows, this DSN attribute is found on the fourth pane of the Setup Dialog, under the heading **Additional connect parameters**.  

On a Unix client, the {{{$ODBCINI}}} DSN keyword to hold this value is **{{{initsql}}}**.

=== Multi-Tier "Enterprise" Edition Setup ===

For connections with our  Multi-Tier driver, the {{{openlink.sql}}} file must be located on the Broker host, and the [[RulesBookSettingsGeneric| Rulebook must be adjusted to specify it]] through the <code>CommandLine</code> Agent setup parameter, and the <code>+initsql</code> argument, for instance --

{{{
Commandline = +initsql /opt/openlink/bin/openlink.sql
}}}
