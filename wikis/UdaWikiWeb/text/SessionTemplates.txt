== Multi-Tier Session Templates==

Connection attributes are conditionally post processed during the initialization of session between an <nop>OpenLink Client and and <nop>OpenLink Agent, the rule book consists of a number of templates that play different roles during this process. The rule book is made up of the following templates: Session Aliases, Mapping Rules, and Agent Configuration

**Session Aliases Templates**
These are rulebook templates used for post-processing Connection Attribute values prior to Mapping Rules evaluation. This is the facility used by the Request Broker for overriding Connection Attributes from Multi-Tier Clients with values on configured a Multi-Tier server.

**Mapping Rules Templates**
These are rule book templates used to determine which Multi-Tier Agents are instantiated in line with a Multi-Tier Client's session request.

**Agent Configuration Templates**
Templates used for setting key Multi-Tier Agent Configuration parameters. See the Multi-Tier Agent Administration section for detailed information.
