= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Multi-Tier "Enterprise" Edition Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources (a/k/a, the ODBC/JDBC/ADO.NET-to-JDBC Bridge), for Unix-like OS =

%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements ==

* Your target data source must be SQL compliant.
* You must have all information necessary to configure a JDBC connection to the data source.

== Software Requirements ==

* You must possess **third-party or native JDBC drivers** that connect to your target data source. A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as the Multi-Tier "Enterprise" Edition Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources.
* The JDBC driver jar file (or a symbolic link to it) must be included in the active {{{CLASSPATH}}}. 
#* Supporting Java libraries (or links to them) may also need to be included in this variable value.
#* Directories containing other supporting libraries may need to be included in one of the other shared library environment variables (e.g., {{{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}}, {{{LIBPATH}}}, {{{SHLIB_PATH}}}).
* You must have a **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** that is compatible with the Multi-Tier "Enterprise" Edition Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources. 
#* Generally, the latest JVM from http://java.com/ is the best choice.
#* If using a 64-bit JDBC Driver, you must have a 64-bit JVM, and 64-bit Multi-Tier "Enterprise" Edition Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* The Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources must be installed on the same machine as the JDBC drivers that connect to the target database.
* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are already in use on the Broker host. These ports are the defaults used by our Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. If other services are using these, you will need to assign different (unused) ports to the new services during installation.
* For best results, the Multi-Tier server components should be installed while logged in as the owner of the local third-party JDBC driver.
* All JDBC-related environment variables should be set prior to installation. This is typically accomplished simply by logging in as the owner of the local third-party JDBC driver, but if logged in as a different user, you can often achieve the same by using that user's <code>.profile</code> or similar, with a command like one of these (depending on your active shell) --
{{{
source ./.profile
. ./.profile
}}}
* You must know the driver class name of your JDBC driver.
* You must know the full details of the JDBC connection URL that connects to your target JDBC Data Source.
