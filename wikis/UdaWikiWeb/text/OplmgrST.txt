==<nop>OpenLink License Manager Usage Notes==
===Single-Tier===

<nop>OpenLink UDA Single-Tier is a single driver installed on the client only.

For releases 6.0, the oplmgr process was started automatically by the driver on first connection. As of release 6.1, this behaviour has changed; in order to facilitate use of License Manager process for administering licenses of all <nop>OpenLink products simultaneously on the same machine, the license-manager must be started explicitly started in advance of services that will use it. The release 6.1 installers now check if a License Manager (oplmgr) process is already running and if not start their own local instance.
