Version {{{1.3.5}}} and previous used the {{{OPL_LICENSE_DIR}}} environment variable to locate the license file directory(ies).


== Location of License files ==

=== License Manager version 1.3.6 and later (UDA Release 6.3 and later) === 

* Default License Folder: 
{{{
/Library/Application Support/openlink/Licenses/
}}}

* Discovery sequence: <i>only</i> the directory(ies) specified with the {{{+directory}}} or {{{-d}}} option, <i>or</i> the single default diretory, {{{.}}} a/k/a the {{{oplmgr}}}'s {{{pwd}}}, will be checked.

If you choose to situate your license files in an alternative location, you can restart the license manager using the new {{{+directory}}} option which is used to identify the folder into which your license files have been placed. <i><b>Note:</b> If you use an alternate location, you will also need to edit the startup script, {{{/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.openlinksw.oplmgr.plist}}}, to target the new location.

Unlike previous versions, License Manager (oplmgr) version {{{1.3.6}}} and higher will search only the directory(ies) specified with the {{{+directory}}} or {{{-d}}} option.

The <nop>OpenLink installer places an automatic start-up script on Mac OS X machines, {{{/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.openlinksw.oplmgr.plist}}} such that the License Manager is always started on boot. The License Manager can also be started and stopped manually using the "{{{oplmgr +[start | stop]}}}" Terminal.app commands.

See the following note on  [[UnableContactLicenseManager | Special Guidance for Mac OS X]]

=== License Manager version 1.3.5 and earlier (UDA Release 6.3 and earlier) === 

* Default License Folder: 
{{{
/Library/Application Support/openlink/bin/
}}}

* Discovery sequence: Default Folder and then any folder exposed by {{{$OPL_LICENSE_DIR}}} environment variable. 

Versions {{{1.3.5}}} or lower of the <nop>OpenLink License Manager ({{{oplmgr}}}) will always search the default {{{/Library/Application Support/openlink/bin/}}} folder before any others.

The <nop>OpenLink installer places an automatic start-up script on Mac OS X machines, such that the License Manager is always started on boot. The License Manager can also be started and stopped manually using the "{{{oplmgr +[start | stop]}}}" Terminal.app commands.
