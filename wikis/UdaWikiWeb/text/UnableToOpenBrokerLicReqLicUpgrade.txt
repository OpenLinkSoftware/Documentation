= Error Message: {{{Product requires a license upgrade}}} =

This error generally indicates an attempt to use a license for one major Release (e.g., 4.x) with a product from a later major Release (e.g., 5.x).

Sometimes it indicates the active license file limits use to machines with fewer processor cores than the active environment.

Sometimes it indicates the active license file permits use on a different operating system than the active environment.

In all situations, you should first [[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/ApplyingLicenseFiles|ensure that the correct license file is active]].

If the error persists, [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp|log a support case]] so we can assist.  

== Evidence ==
* A copy of the active license file
* Details about the licensed environment
#* the complete version of the OS
#* the number of processor cores in the licensed host
#* whether the processors are Hyperthreading capable and whether this has been enabled
#* the complete version of the <nop>OpenLink components
