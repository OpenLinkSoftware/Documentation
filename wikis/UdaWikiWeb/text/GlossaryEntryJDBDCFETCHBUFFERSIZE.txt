===/FETCHBUFFERSIZE===

/FBS or /<nop>FetchBufferSize is a Type 3 JDBC connect string parameter. The value passed by /FBS represents the number of rows of resultset data, which you want fetched before data is returned to your client.

A high /FBS value reduces the need to traverse back and forth across the network. However, a high /FBS will result in longer intervals between the arrival of data. A smaller /FBS value entails a greater number of trips across the network. However, smaller /FBS values alleviate the potential for timeouts, when resultsets are large.
