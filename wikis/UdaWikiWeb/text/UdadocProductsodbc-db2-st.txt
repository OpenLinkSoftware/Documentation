The Single-Tier ODBC Drivers for DB2 conform to the common architectural perceptions of an ODBC driver -- a single component installed on a desktop, workstation, or application server machine that depends on additional database specific networking middleware (from the relevant database vendor) for local or remote database connectivity. 

The [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier Drivers for DB2 are a Type A class driver developed using the DB2CLI call level interface and assumes the prior installation of DB2Connect depending on your DB2 Server release. 

These drivers are currently available for DB2 versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x and beyond.
