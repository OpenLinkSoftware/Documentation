=Session Rules Administration & Configuration Guide=

One of the most important features and benefits of our Multi Data Access Drivers, is the ability to configure and control the entire infrastructure from a central point using "<nop>OpenLink Session Rules". These session rules are stored and maintained in a text based repository called the "Session Rulebook" (the file "oplrqb.ini").

You administer these rules from your web browser using the <nop>OpenLink Admin Assistant. The rules that you create are enforced by the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker, giving you phenomenal control over your distributed computing infrastructure.
