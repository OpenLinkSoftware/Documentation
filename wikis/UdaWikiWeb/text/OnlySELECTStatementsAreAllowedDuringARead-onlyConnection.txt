===Only SELECT statements are allowed during a read-only connection===

The "Only SELECT statements are allowed" error message suggest that you have read-only permissions on the table against which you are trying to query. Review this possibility. Additionally, your <nop>OpenLink Session Rules Book may be enforcing READONLY connections. The following instructions will help you to verify or dismiss this fact:

1. Use a text editor to open the oplrqb.ini file which you find in the /bin sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink server components installation.

2. Scroll down to [Domain Aliases].

3. Locate the domain, which you pass in the Domain or <nop>ServerType field of your client's DSN. For example:

{{{
Progress 82A = pro82a
}}}

4. Scroll down to [Mapping Rules].

5. Locate your domain alias abbreviation. For example:

{{{
pro82a:*:*:*:*:*:* = accept generic_pro82a
}}}

6. Find the [generic_xxxx] section which is associated with your alias. For example:

{{{
[generic_pro82a]
Description = Default settings for Informix 7.2 agent
Program = pro82a_sv
Environment = PROGRESS82A
OpsysLogin = Yes
ReUse = never
;CommandLine =
;ConnectOptions =
;Directory = /tmp
;Database =
;Userid =
;Password =
ReadOnly = Yes
}}}

7. Insure that <nop>ReadOnly is set to No. For example:

{{{
ReadOnly = No
}}}

9. If you make changes, restart or reinitialize your <nop>OpenLink Request Broker.

Finally, one build of <nop>OpenLink's 3.2 software (3.20.09.14) contains a bug. These 3.2 clients issue a <nop>SQLSetConnectOption ODBC API call, which sets the SQL_ACCESS_MODE to 1. This enforces a read-only connection. Below, you will see a sample ODBC API call associated with this problem:

{{{
ENTER SQLSetConnectOption
HDBC 091D14D8
UWORD 101 <SQL_ACCESS_MODE>
SQLLEN 1
}}}

If your 3.2 software contains this bug, you will need to upgrade your software. (The fix was introduced in <nop>OpenLink 4.0.) If you are uncertain about the presence of a bug, forward a trace and yourclient driver version to <nop>OpenLink Product Support.
