==Understanding the Oracle native client ==

The Oracle native client is an Oracle product that provides access to Oracle databases via the Oracle proprietary communications protocol. At the time of writing, this product is called Net8, Net9, or Net10 depending on the version of the database to which you want to connect. However, marketing names are subject to change.

Note: SQL*Net is the Oracle 7 database native client.
