*Use your database native transaction monitor to see if [[OpenLink]]  drivers are locked in pending transactions. [[OpenLink]]  drivers cannot disconnect from a database while they are still engaged in transactions.  
*Ensure that your application does not enforce manual commits. Use of manual commit may encourage the behavior described above.  
*Check the database native error logs for failures that may contribute to this problem.  
*Create a client-side ODBC trace. Examine the trace to ensure that the application sends the proper sequence of SQLFree()s and SQLDisconnect()s to the driver.  
*Ensure [[OpenLink]]  's Progress drivers connect to Progress databases in sockets mode. A Progress shared memory library bug causes failure to disconnect.  
*Contact [[OpenLink]]  Product Support, if you use Progress 91C or 91D. [[OpenLink]]  is working to resolve occurrences of lingering agents that are not associated with the shared memory bug.  
*Recreate the problem.  
*Run oplshut -s on a command line.  
*Observe the number of [[OpenLink]]  database agent processes.  
*Compare the output of oplshut -s with a Unix ps -ef or Windows Task Manager.  
*Upgrade if oplshut -s or the Windows Task Manager shows more agent processes.
