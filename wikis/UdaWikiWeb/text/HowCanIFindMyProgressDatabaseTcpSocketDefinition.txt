= Discovering a Progress server's sockets definition =

# Log in to your Progress DBMS server.
# Locate the database log file. Typically, the log file should have the same name as the database {{{.db}}} file with a {{{.lg}}} extension; e.g., the {{{sports92.db}}} file will typically have a corresponding {{{sports92.lg}}} file.
# Make a copy of the database log file.
# Open the copy with a text editor.
# Locate the section covering to the most recent database startup.
# Find the socket parameters. For example:
{{{
1:50:04 BROKER  0: Host Name (-H): oplusaix3. (4261)
1:50:04 BROKER  0: Service Name (-S): pro91d. (4262)
1:50:04 BROKER  0: Network Type (-N): tcp. (4263)
}}}
# Record the value shown for Host Name.  Some versions of Progress will only connect if your ODBC connection specifies exactly the same value -- i.e., {{{oplusaix3.example.com}}} and {{{192.168.123.234}}} will not work for the above instance, even if they all resolve to the same IP address; only {{{oplusaix3}}} will work.
# Record the value shown for Service Name.  This is your database's socket service name or number.
# Exit the {{{.lg}}} file. The copy you made may safely be discarded.
# If you found a service name above, and not a port number, grep the local {{{/etc/services}}} file for the service name to identify the associated TCP port number. For example:
{{{
% grep pro91d /etc/services
pro91d   8893/tcp
}}}
# Exit the file.
