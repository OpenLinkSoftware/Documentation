==Where is the <nop>PostgreSQL error log?==

<nop>PostgreSQL writes error output to screen. To alter this behavior, logging must be setup in the postgresql.conf file. Use the following instructions to setup logging or identify pre-set error logs:

1. Login to the machine that contains the <nop>PostgreSQL instance.
2. su to the <nop>PostgreSQL user.
3. Execute the .profile associated with the <nop>PostgreSQL user.
4. cd into the database sub-directory of the <nop>PostgreSQL installation.
5. vi the postgresql.conf file.
6. Locate the log_destination parameter.
7. Locate the log_directory parameter.
8. Locate the log_filename parameter.

The log_ destination should pass syslog, redirect_ stderr, or eventlog (Windows). If redirect_ stderr is used, the log_ directory and log_ filename will show the directory and filenames that contain the redirected error output.

If log_ destination is false or stderr, errors are only written to screen. No logs are being created. Read the following documentation and implement logging as described:
