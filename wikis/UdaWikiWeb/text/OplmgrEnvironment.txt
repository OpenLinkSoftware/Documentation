==<nop>OpenLink License Manager Usage Notes==
===Environment Variables===

The <nop>OpenLink License Manager will search through directories in the OPL_LICENSE_DIR variable or failing that, the PATH environment variable, for files matching *.lic.

<nop>OpenLink recommends you use /etc/oplmgr/ to store your licenses; each product installation will include a copy of the oplmgr executable in its respective 'bin' directory, such that if this is the only <nop>OpenLink product on the system, it can be manually started and used for processing licenses with an appropriate OPL_LICENSE_DIR value. A generic system startup script is also being developed for Unix systems to enable the License Manager process to be automatically started on machine boot. If found, product installers will automatically append this to your OPL_LICENSE_DIR variable.
