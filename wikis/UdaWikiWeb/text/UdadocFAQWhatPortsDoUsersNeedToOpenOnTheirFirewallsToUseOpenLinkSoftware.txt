%TOC%

   
Single-Tier users should not need to open ports to accommodate the Single-Tier driver. However, ports may need to be opened to facilitate connections between the database native client and the database to which it connects. Multi-Tier users need to take the following action, if a firewall surrounds the machine that contains the Multi-Tier server components: 

*Login to the machine that contains the Multi-Tier server components.  
*Use a text editor to open the oplrqb.ini file that resides in the /bin sub-directory of the [[OpenLink]]  installation.  
*Locate the [Protocol TCP] section. For example: 
{{{
[Protocol TCP] PingWatchdog = No ; Send check-alive packets PingInterval = 600 ; every <PingInterval> seconds ;IPAddress = 127.0.0.1 ; Overrules found interface address PortLow = 5000 PortHigh = 5020 
}}}
 
*Make sure [[PortHigh]]  is uncommented and set. [[PortHigh]]  should equal [[PortLow]]  + the number of concurrent connections granted by the license + a few extra ports.  
*Record the [[PortLow]]  - [[PortHigh]]  range.  
*Record the Listen port value. ( [[OpenLink]]  1.x and 3.x do not have Listen.)  
*Close oplrqb.ini.  
*Open the Listen and [[PortLow]]  - [[PortHigh]]  TCP ports on the firewall.  
*Open UDP port #60001--in addition to TCP [[PortLow]]  - [[PortHigh]]  --to accommodate 1.x and 3.x drivers.
