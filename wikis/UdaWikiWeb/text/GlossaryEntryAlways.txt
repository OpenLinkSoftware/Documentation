===Always===

Always is a Multi-Tier server component setting; specifically, it is a setting for the Agent "Reuse" value, and is found in the [generic_{{{<Agent>}}}] section of the oplrqb.ini file (where {{{<Agent>}}} corresponds to the database Agent alias matching your database.)

"Always" specifies that all client connections will be serviced by the same Database Agent process.  You may also wish to enforce a conditional Database Agent "Reuse" setting.  For example, after an Agent has accepted a certain number of connections, the Request Broker can spawn a new Agent process based on a conditional Reuse limit you impose.  

Agent reuse rules are configurable via the Admin Assistant (typically running at http://localhost:8000 on the Multi-Tier server component host machine), in the Database Agent settings section of the Server Components Administration.

Example:

{{{
   [generic_ora81]
   Reuse = Always
}}}
