==Do I need <nop>OpenLink's Universal Data Access Drivers?==

Do you need to connect to an internal or external database from a desktop productivity tool (Spreadsheet, Word Processor, Presentation Package etc.), application development environment, or web application? If so, you may need <nop>OpenLink Data Access Drivers. The aforementioned application or environment must be ODBC, JDBC, OLEDB, or ADO.NET compliant and use the TCP/IP network protocol. 

If you do not have such a need or your application or environment does not meet these requirements, you probably may not need <nop>OpenLink's Universal Data Access Drivers. You may need <nop>OpenLink Virtuoso or products or services from another software vendor. Contact <nop>OpenLink Product Support for additional information.
