= License Manager Usage Notes for Windows =

The default and suggested locations of <nop>OpenLink License files varies depending on the operating system in use and License Manager version.

%TOC%

== Determining the Installed Version of the License Manager ==

The License Manager ({{{oplmgr.exe}}}) on Windows is installed in {{{%windir%\oplmgr.exe}}} and runs as a Windows service.

The <nop>OpenLink License Manager is installed in the Windows system directory ({{{%WINDOWS%}}}) and run as a Windows Service which is automatically started on Windows boot.

The License Manager can also be started and stopped manually using the {{{oplmgr /[start | stop]}}} commands, or through the Services or Component Services control panels (generally found in the Administrative sub-directory). The version of {{{oplmgr.exe}}} can be obtained by right clicking on the executable and checking the {{{Details}}} tab and will be something like {{{1.3.5.1}}}.



== Location of License files ==

The <nop>OpenLink License Manager uses <b>only</b> Windows Registry string values to specify the folders to be searched for license files, in the following registry key location:
{{{
\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
   SOFTWARE\
      OpenLink Software\
         License Manager\
            License Directories\
}}}

The <nop>OpenLink installer creates the initial string key value, based on the chosen installation directory.  The default installation directory for the <nop>OpenLink Data Access drivers is {{{C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\}}}, so the default registry key is:
{{{
uda      = C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin\
}}}
The default installation directory for <nop>OpenLink Virtuoso is {{{C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\Virtuoso X\}}}, so the default registry key is:
{{{
virtuoso = C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\Virtuoso X\bin\
}}}

=== Special Considerations on 64-bit Windows ===

The binary installed to {{{%windir%\oplmgr.exe}}} matches the bitness of the first installer you ran, so either the 32-bit or 64-bit {{{oplmgr.exe}}} may be present on your system.  You can confirm the bitness of this executable by inspecting it with [[http://www.dependencywalker.com/|Microsoft's Dependency Walker]]

If you install 32-bit software on 64-bit Windows, the Registry settings go into the <code>Wow6432Node</code> branch --
{{{
\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
   SOFTWARE\
      Wow6432Node\
         OpenLink Software\
            License Manager\
               License Directories\
}}}
-- and the default keys become --
{{{
uda      = C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin\
virtuoso = C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenLink Software\Virtuoso X\bin\
}}}

Th 64-bit License Manager will not see these 32-bit settings, and the 32-bit License Manage will not see the 64-bit settings above.  Therefore, for best results in environments where you have both 32-bit and 64-bit <nop>OpenLink components installed, we recommend creating a shortcut from the 32-bit location to the 64-bit location (or vice versa), and putting all license file into that single directory; then, it will not matter which License Manager runs, as all licenses will be found.

You may also choose to have all Registry keys point to a single filesystem directory, into which you place all license files.  In this case, we recommend the directory be --

{{{
C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\Licenses\
}}}
