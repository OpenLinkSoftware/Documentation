= Identifying the Progress startup mode (i.e., sockets vs. shared memory) =

# Log in to your Progress DBMS server.
# Locate the database log file. Typically, the log file should have the same name as the database {{{.db}}} file with a {{{.lg}}} extension; e.g., the {{{sports92.db}}} file will typically have a corresponding {{{sports92.lg}}} file.
# Make a copy of the database log file.
# Open the copy with a text editor.
# Locate the section covering to the most recent database startup.
# Look for lines containing //{{{Host Name}}}//, //{{{Service Name}}}//, and //{{{Network Type}}}//.  These are Progress sockets startup parameters. {{{Host Name}}} and {{{Service Name}}} should always be present.  For example:
{{{
1:50:04 BROKER  0: Host Name (-H): oplusaix3. (4261)
11:50:04 BROKER  0: Service Name (-S): pro91d. (4262)
11:50:04 BROKER  0: Network Type (-N): tcp. (4263)
}}}
# The important entry for this question is {{{Network Type}}} --
#* If {{{Network Type}}} "{{{tcp}}}" is present, the database is running in //sockets// mode. 
#* If {{{Network Type}}} "{{{tcp}}}" is not present, the database is running in //shared memory// mode.
