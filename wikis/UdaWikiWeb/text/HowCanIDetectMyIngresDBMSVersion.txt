=Detecting the Ingres DBMS version=

Ingres versions have been very confusing over the years.  They went up to Ingres 6.x; then renamed to Ingres II 1.x and 2.x; then renumbered back to Ingres II 9.x, which was also branded r3 (3.0.x) and Ingres 2006; and now Ingres 9.3; and coming soon Ingres 10.x.

There are a few ways to learn the version of //your// Ingres installation. 

If you have any functional SQL connection to the Ingres instance, you should be able to execute the following query --
{{{
SELECT _version();
}}}

Output will look something like this --
{{{
II 2.6/0305 (hp2.us5/00)
}}}

There are simple text files on Windows and Unix which should reveal the version information --
| **Windows**  | <code><nowiki>$II_SYSTEM/ingres/version</nowiki></code>  |
| **Unix**  | <code><nowiki>$II_SYSTEM/ingres/version.rel</nowiki></code>  |

This (and much more) information may also be found in the {{{install.log}}} file, typically found in the  {{{$II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/}}} directory, where it will look something like this --
{{{
This procedure will set up the following release of the Ingres
Intelligent DBMS:

		 II 2.6/0305 (hp2.us5/00)
}}}
