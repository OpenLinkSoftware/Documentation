==Name of .taz files==

.taz file names are useful for detecting product and operating system incompatibilities. (Failure to install, core dumps, segmentation faults, signals, and blatant incompatibility errors are all possible side effects of product and os mismatch.) 

If you suspect an incompatibility, obtain the name of the .taz file and a uname -a from the affected machine. Decode the .taz file name using <nop>OpenLink's file naming convention fact sheet to see if it was intended for the your operating system.
