= Error Message: {{{Disconnected from server because database name was incorrect. (437)}}} or {{{Remote Database Name not valid}}} =

Provide the full path to the database file in the "Database Name" field in your ODBC Data Source Names. This value may be case-sensitive, depending on your version of Progress, and should exactly match the <code>-db</code> argument used to launch the Progress server (e.g., <code>_mproserv</code>). 

If the problem persists, you may need to update your UDA components, particularly if you are connecting to Progress/<nop>OpenEdge 10. Changes to the Progress 10 SQL-92 engine forced us to change the way that we pass the database name to the server. This enhancement has been incorporated into Release 6.2 and later components.

* Request Broker Log File
* Request Broker Rulebook
* DBMS Version
* Progress launch attributes (most easily discovered in the <code>.lg</code> file)
