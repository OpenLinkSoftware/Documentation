===Administrative Assistant===

The Administrative Assistant is the graphical user interface, which ships with <nop>OpenLink's Multi-Tier drivers. During installation, you will be requested to specify the port on which the Assistant listens. Once installed, you must activate the Broker process. Then, type the following into any web browser on your network: 
<P>
{{{http://your_server_name:port#}}}
<P>
For example:  {{{http://localhost:8000}}}
<P>
This will open the Assistant. You may then use the Assistant to edit your Request Broker and database agents parameters. You may also use it create DSN's local to the machine, from which the Assistant is called. In fact, if you install and activate a Broker on your client, you may use the Admin Assistant to create clientside DSNs and edit client networking parameters.
