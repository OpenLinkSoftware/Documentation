Version {{{1.3.6}}} or higher uses the new {{{+directory}}} parameter option for the {{{oplmgr}}} program to specify the location license files should be found.


== Location of License files ==

=== License Manager version 1.3.5 and earlier (UDA Release 6.3 and earlier) === 

Versions {{{1.3.5}}} or lower of the <nop>OpenLink License Manager ({{{oplmgr}}}) will search through directories in the {{{OPL_LICENSE_DIR}}} variable.

<nop>OpenLink recommends you use {{{/etc/oplmgr/}}} to store your licenses. Each product installation will include a copy of the {{{oplmgr}}} executable in its respective {{{bin}}} directory, such that if this is the only <nop>OpenLink product on the system, it can be manually started and used for processing licenses with an appropriate {{{OPL_LICENSE_DIR}}} or {{{+directory}}} parameter option value. A generic system startup script is also being developed for Unix systems to enable the License Manager process to be automatically started on machine boot. Product installers will automatically append this to your {{{OPL_LICENSE_DIR}}} variable, via the {{{openlink.sh/csh}}} script.

=== License Manager version 1.3.6 and later (UDA Release 6.3 and later) === 

The <nop>OpenLink License Manager ({{{oplmgr}}}) will search through directories in the {{{OPL_LICENSE_DIR}}} variable and  the new {{{+directory}}} parameter option for {{{1.3.6}}} or higher License Manager versions, with fall back to directories in the {{{PATH}}} environment variable, for files matching {{{*.lic}}}.

<nop>OpenLink recommends you use {{{/etc/oplmgr/}}} to store your licenses. Each product installation will include a copy of the {{{oplmgr}}} executable in its respective {{{bin}}} directory, such that if this is the only <nop>OpenLink product on the system, it can be manually started and used for processing licenses with an appropriate {{{OPL_LICENSE_DIR}}} or {{{+directory}}} parameter option value.
