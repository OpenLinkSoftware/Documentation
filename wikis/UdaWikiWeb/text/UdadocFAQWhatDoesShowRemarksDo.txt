%TOC%

   
Show Remarks affects the output from SQLColumns. 

When enabled, the REMARKS column of a SQLColumns result set includes the comments from the COMMENTS column of the Oracle ALL **COL_COMMENTS data dictionary view. When disabled, the REMARKS column is empty. ** 

Disabling Show Remarks improves performance.
