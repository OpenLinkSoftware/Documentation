| *Name* | *Description* |
| **<nop>IfxPORTNO_SECONDARY** | Specifies the port number of the secondary database server in an HDR pair. The port number is listed in the /etc/services file. |
| **<nop>IfxIFXHOST_SECONDARY** | Sets the secondary host name or host IP address for HDR connection redirection | 
| **<nop>IfxINFORMIXSERVER_SECONDARY** | Specifies the secondary database server in an HDR pair to which an explicit or implicit connection is made by a client application, if the primary database server is unavailable | 
| **<nop>IfxENABLE_HDRSWITCH** | When set to 'true', secondary server properties are used to connect to the secondary server in an HDR pair, if the primary server is unavailable. | 
| **<nop>IfxJDBCTEMP** | Specifies where temporary files for handling smart large objects are created. You must supply an absolute path. |
| **<nop>IfxSECURITY** | Uses 56-bit encryption to send the password to the server. If 'PASSWORD' is specified, the user-provided password is encrypted using 56-bit encryption when it is passed from the client to the database server. There is no default setting. The setting is supported in 7.31, 8.3+, and 9.x and later versions of the Informix database server. | 
| **<nop>IfxPROXY** | Specifies an HTTP proxy server. | 
| **<nop>IfxSQLH_TYPE** | When set to 'FILE', specifies that database information (such as host-name, port-number, user, and password) is specified in a sqlhosts file. When set to 'LDAP', specifies that this information is specified in an LDAP server | 
| **<nop>IfxSQLH_FILE** | Example: http://host-name:port-number/sqlhosts.ius or file://D:/local/myown/sqlhosts.ius |
| **<nop>IfxLDAP_URL** | Example: ldap://host-name:port-number |
| **<nop>IfxLDAP_IFXBASE** | Example: Informix-base-DN | 
| **<nop>IfxLDAP_USER** |A valid LDAP username| 
| **<nop>IfxLDAP_PASSWD** |A valid LDAP password| 
| **<nop>IfxSQLH_LOC** |When used in conjunction with other LDAP keywords, the SQLH_LOC keyword indicates where an LDAP lookup should occur. SQLH_LOC can have a value of either CLIENT or PROXY. If the value is CLIENT, the driver performs the LDAP lookup on the client side. If the value is PROXY, the proxy performs the lookup on the server side. If no value is specified, the driver uses CLIENT as the default value.| 
| **<nop>IfxFET_BUF_SIZE** | Overrides the default setting for the size of the fetch buffer for all data except large objects. The default size is 4096 bytes. | 
| **<nop>IfxBIG_FET_BUF_SIZE** | In IBM Informix Extended Parallel Server Version 8.4, overrides the default size of the tuple buffer and allows it to be increased up to 2GB. |
| **<nop>IfxUSEV5SERVER** | When set to 1, specifies that the Java program is connecting to an IBM Informix <nop>OnLine 5.x or IBM Informix SE 5.x or IBM Informix SE 7.x database server. This environment variable is mandatory, if you are connecting to an IBM Informix <nop>OnLine 5.x or IBM Informix SE 5.x or IBM Informix SE 7.x database server. | 
| **vIfxLOBCACHE** | Determines the buffer size for large object data that is fetched from the database server Possible values are:  1) Numbers greater than zero. The maximum number of bytes is allocated in memory to hold the data. If the data size exceeds the LOBCACHE value, the data is stored in a temporary file. If a security violation occurs during creation of this file, the data is stored in memory. 2) Zero. The data is always stored in a file. If a security violation occurs, the driver makes no attempt to store the data in memory. 3) A negative number. The data is always stored in memory. If the required amount of memory is not available, an error occurs. | 
| **<nop>IfxIFX_USEPUT** | When set to 1, enables bulk inserts. | 
| **<nop>IfxDELIMIDENT** | When set to true, specifies that strings set off by double quotes are delimited identifiers. | 
| **<nop>IfxINFORMIXSTACKSIZE** | Specifies the stack size, in kilobytes, that the database server uses for a particular client session.|  
| **<nop>IfxDBSPACETEMP** | Specifies the dbspaces in which temporary tables are built. | 
| **<nop>IfxDB_LOCALE** | Specifies the locale of the database. The IBM Informix JDBC Driver uses this variable to perform code-set conversion between Unicode and the database locale. Together with the CLIENT_LOCALE variable, the database server uses this variable to establish the server processing locale. The DB_LOCALE and CLIENT_LOCALE values must be the same, or their code sets must be convertible. | 
| **<nop>IfxCLIENT_LOCALE** | Specifies the locale of the client that is accessing the database. Provides defaults for user-defined formats such as the GL_DATE format. User-defined data types can use it for code-set conversion. Together with the DB_LOCALE variable, the database server uses this variable to establish the server processing locale. The DB_LOCALE and CLIENT_LOCALE values must be the same, or their code sets must be convertible. | 
| **<nop>IfxDBDATE** | Specifies the end-user formats of values in DATE columns supported for backward compatibility; GL_DATE is preferred. | 
| **<nop>IfxGL_DATE** | Specifies the end-user formats of values in DATE columns This variable is supported in Informix database server versions 7.2x, 8.x, 9.x, and 10.x. | 
| **<nop>IfxDBCENTURY** | Enables you to specify the appropriate expansion for one- or two-digit year DATE values. | 
| **<nop>IfxSTMT_CACHE** | When set to 1, enables the use of the shared-statement cache in a session. This feature can reduce memory consumption and speed query processing among different user sessions. The driver does not use this variable. It just passes the value to the server. | 
| **<nop>IfxNODEFDAC** | When set to YES, prevents default table and routine privileges from being granted to the PUBLIC user when a new table or routine is created in a database that is not ANSI compliant. Default is NO. | 
| **<nop>IfxDBTEMP** | Specifies the full pathname of the directory into which you want IBM Informix Enterprise Gateway products to place their temporary files and temporary tables. The driver does not use this variable. It just passes the value to the server. | 
| **<nop>IfxPSORT_DBTEMP** | Specifies one or more directories to which the database server writes the temporary files it uses when performing a sort. | 
| **<nop>IfxPSORT_NPROCS** | Enables the database server to improve the performance of the parallel-process sorting package by allocating more threads for sorting. | 
| **<nop>IfxDBUPSPACE** | Specifies the amount of system disk space that the UPDATE STATISTICS statement can use when it simultaneously constructs multiple-column distributions. | 
| **<nop>IfxPDQPRIORITY** | Determines the degree of parallelism used by the database server. | 
| **<nop>IfxIFX_DIRECTIVES** | Determines whether the optimizer allows query optimization directives from within a query. This variable is set on the client. The driver does not use this variable. It just passes the value to the server. | 
| **<nop>IfxIFX_EXTDIRECTIVES** | Specifies whether the query optimizer allows external query optimization directives from the sysdirectives system catalog table to be applied to queries in existing applications. The default is OFF. Possible values: 1) ON External optimizer directives accepted, 2) OFF External optimizer directives not accepted, 3) 1 External optimizer directives accepted, and 4) 0 External optimizer directives not accepted. | 
| **<nop>IfxOPTCOMPIND** | Specifies the join method that the query optimizer uses. | 
| **<nop>IfxINFORMIXCONRETRY** | Specifies the maximum number of additional connection attempts that can be made to each database server by the client during the time limit specified by the value of INFORMIXCONTIME. | 
| **<nop>IfxINFORMIXCONTIME** | Sets the timeout period for an attempt to connect to the database server. If a connection attempt does not succeed in this time, the attempt is aborted and a connection error is reported. The default value is 0 seconds. This variable adds timeouts for blocking socket methods and for socket connections. | 
| **<nop>IfxINFORMIXOPCACHE** | Specifies the size of the memory cache for the staging-area blobspace of the client application. | 
| **<nop>IfxPLCONFIG** | Specifies the name of the configuration file used by the high-performance loader. | 
| **<nop>IfxPATH** | Specifies the directories that should be searched for executable programs. | 
| **<nop>IfxPLOAD_LO_PATH** | Specifies the pathname for smart-large-object handles (which identify the location of smart large objects such as BLOB, CLOB, and BOOLEAN data types). The driver does not use this variable. It just passes the value to the server. | 
| **<nop>IfxOPT_GOAL** | Specifies the query performance goal for the optimizer. Set this variable in the user environment before you start an application. The driver does not use this variable. It just passes the value to the server. | 
| **<nop>IfxDBANSIWARN** | When set to 1, checks for Informix extensions to ANSI-standard syntax. | 
| **<nop>IfxIFX_CODESETLOB** | The value of this variable determines whether code-set conversion is done in memory or in temporary files. If set to 0, code-set conversion uses temporary files. If set to a value greater than 0, code-set conversion occurs in the memory of the client computer, and the value represents the number of bytes of memory allocated for the conversion. | 
| **<nop>IfxIFX_LOCK_MODE_WAIT** | The default value is 0 (do not wait for the lock). Sets the value of Informix-specific variable IFX_LOCK_MODE_WAIT. Possible values: 1d) '-1' WAIT until the lock is released, 2) '0' DO NOT WAIT, end the operation, and return with error, and 3) 'nn' WAIT for nn seconds for the lock to be released. | 
| **<nop>IfxIFX_ISOLATION_LEVEL** | Sets the value of Informix-specific variable IFX_ISOLATION_LEVEL. Possible values: 1) '1' - Dirty Read (equivalent to TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED), 2) '2' - Committed Read (equivalent to TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED), 3) '3' - Cursor Stability (equivalent to TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED), 4) '4' - Repeatable Read (equivalent to TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ) | 
# Click continue to proceed to the Options tab. This tab contains optional parameters that are not required for basic ODBC connectivity:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-inf-19.png"/>%BR%%BR%
#*  **Row Buffer Size ** - This attribute specifies the number of records to be transported over the network in a single network hop. Values can range from 1 to 99.
#*  **Hide Login Dialog ** - Suppresses the ODBC "Username" and "Password" login dialog boxes when interacting with your ODBC DSN from within an ODBC compliant application.
#*  **Read Only connection ** - Specifies whether the connection is "Read-only." Make sure the checkbox is unchecked to request a "Read/Write" connection.
#*  **Drop Catalog from Meta calls ** - Enable this option to have the catalog name not appear for tables, views, and procedures when requesting database meta-data.
#*  **No support of quoted identifier ** - If set, the call <nop>SQLGetInfo for 'SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR' will return a space (" "). It can be used if the DBMS doesn't support quoted SQL like select * from "account."
#*  **Drop Schema from Meta calls ** - Enable this option to have the schema-name not appear for tables, views, and procedures when requesting database meta-data.
#*  **SQLStatistics disabled ** -  Check this box to have SQLStatistics() return an empty resultset. Use this if the underlying database does not support retrieval of statistics about a table (e.g. what indexes it has).
#*   **No support of search string escape ** - If set, the call <nop>SQLGetInfo for 'SQL_LIKE_ESCAPE_CLAUSE' will return a space (" "). It can be used if the DBMS doesn't support SQL escape patterns.
#*  **Patch of NULL size of SQL_CHAR ** -  If set, this option overrides the size of SQL_CHAR column type returned by the database with the value set in the text box (in bytes). With a default value of 0, the driver uses the size returned by the database.
#*  **SQL_DBMS Name ** - Manually overrides the <nop>SQLGetInfo(SQL_DBMS_NAME) response returned by the driver. This is required for products like Microsoft <nop>InfoPath for which the return the value should be "SQL Server".
# Click continue to proceed to the Preferences tab. This tab contains optional parameters that are not required for basic ODBC connectivity:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ee-inf-20.png"/>%BR%%BR%
#*  **Initialization SQL ** - Lets you specify a file containing SQL statements that will be run automatically against the database upon connection.
#*  **Cursor Sensitivity ** - Enables or disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library calculates checksums for each row in the current rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already stored in the row version cache for the same rows when fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the row has been updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user's point of view, the only visible difference between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same. Deleted rows don't appear in the rowset. Updates to the row since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in the rowset, if their keys fall within the span of the rowset. If your application does not need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the 'High Cursor Sensitivity' checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the table oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the appropriate script for the target database.
#*  **Max Rows Override ** - Allows you to define a limit on the maximum number of rows to be returned from a query. The default value of 0 means no limit.
#*  **Disable Autocommit ** - Changes the default commit behaviour of the <nop>OpenLink driver. The default mode is <nop>AutoCommit (box unchecked).
#*  **Disable Rowset Size Limit ** - Disables a limitation enforced by the cursor library. This limitation is enforced by default. It prevents the driver from claiming all available memory in the event that a resultset  generated from an erroneous query is very large. The limit is normally never reached.
#*  **Defer fetching of long data ** - Defers fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data unless explicitly requested in a query. This provides significant performance increases when fields in query do not include LONG data fields.
#*  **Multiple Active Statements Emulation ** - Enables use of Multiple Active statements in an ODBC application even if the underlying database does not allow this, as it is emulated in the driver.
