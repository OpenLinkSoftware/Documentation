===Command Line===

[1] The first Command Line variable (<nop>CommandLine)appears in the [Request Broker] section of the <nop>OpenLink Session Rules Book. You may use this parameter to hardcode debug and other parameters, which the Broker is designed to recognize. Run {{{./oplrqb -?}}} or {{{oplrqb -?}}} to return a complete list. Be advised -- Parameters--which are written into the Rules Book-- will override parameters which are passed to the Broker at startup. 

Example: {{{CommandLine= +loglevel 7 +logfile }}}

[2] The second <nop>OpenLink Command Line variables appear in the {{{[generic_xxx]}}} sections of the Rules Book and the Admin Assistant's Database Agent Settings Form. These variables may take +initsql, +jetfix, or other arguments, which a database agent may recognize at runtime. Run the agent name followed by a -? to determine argument usage. 

Example: 

{{{
CommandLine = +initsql /dbs/oracle/lockmode.sql 
}}}
