= Error Message: {{{Number of licensed users exceeded}}} =

In this context, "users" means "client host machines," counted by unique IP addresses.

This error means that concurrent connections are being requested from more IP addresses than your active license file permits.

If you know how many client hosts you require to be simultaneously connected, you can immediately [[http://www.openlinksw.com/contact| pursue an upgrade with Sales]].

If you don't know how many client hosts must simultaneously connect, or feel that this message is itself an error, please [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp| log a Support Case]], and we'll work with you to find the best resolution.
