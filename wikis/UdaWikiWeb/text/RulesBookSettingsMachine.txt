===[Machine Aliases]===

This section will replace a machine name with an internal alias. This alias is used in the fifth colon delimited field of a mapping rule.

This example will map two different machine names to one of 'adminpc'. Also anything containing the word 'sales' such as mysales, sales, sales2 is then mapped to 'sales' alias.

{{{
[Machine Aliases]
fredspc|johnspc    = adminpc
sales              = sales
}}}
