= Known Issues with the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition OLE DB Provider for ODBC Data Sources -- Visual Basic 6 and ADO =

* When specifying the SQL for the {{{Recordsource}}} property in an ADO Data Control ({{{ADO DC}}}), you must quote the table name. %BR%%BR%
#* If you do not quote the tablename, VB will convert your SQL to lowercase and //then// quote the table name when attempting an update; e.g., if you enter 
{{{
SELECT * FROM EMP
}}}
when attempting an update, this will become 
{{{
update "emp"
}}}
when VB submits the query to the DBMS. Databases which support case-sensitive schema object names (which include most modern DBMS) will then either reject VB's query, complaining that the table doesn't exist, or deliver results based on the wrong table. %BR%%BR%
#* To avoid this problem, enter the query as, e.g.,  
{{{
SELECT * FROM "EMP"
}}}
