= Using Microsoft Excel's Web Query functionality on Mac OS X =

You may have seen an error message like <blockquote><i>To refresh a query, you must first install the appropriate ODBC driver for this version of Excel on your computer. For information about obtaining ODBC drivers, visit Microsoft website at [[http://microsoft.com/mac/| http://microsoft.com/mac/]].</i> </blockquote>

Microsoft's knowledgebase suggests a need a for ODBC drivers to enable Web Query and other functionality in Excel on Mac, but this is not accurate.

Microsoft Excel (and more accurately Microsoft Query) <i>do</i> depend on iODBC library files.

iODBC is the free and open source ODBC driver manager on Mac OS X, which we (<nop>OpenLink Software) maintain & support, and which Apple has bundled into Mac OS X since [[https://opensource.apple.com/release/mac-os-x-103/| Panther (10.3.x)]], up to and including [[https://opensource.apple.com/release/os-x-1013/| High Sierra (10.13.x)]].

Unfortunately, Apple has always lagged behind updates made to the iODBC project -- today, Apple is shipping iODBC 3.52.6 (October, 2007) in High Sierra, even though iODBC has been updated several times, to deliver compatibility with various macOS updates (see the iODBC [[http://www.iodbc.org/dataspace/iodbc/wiki/iODBC/ChangeNotes| change log]]) &mdash;

| *minimum&nbsp;compatible iODBC&nbsp;version* | *release date* | *updated for macOS version(s)* |
|  3.52.7  |  September, 2009  |  Lion (10.7.x)  |
|  3.52.8  |  March, 2012  |  Mountain Lion (10.8.x)  |
|  3.52.9  |  April, 2014  |  Mavericks (10.9.x)  |
|  3.52.10  |  February, 2015  |  Yosemite (10.10.x)  |
|  3.52.12  |  June, 2016  |  El Capitan (10.11.x), %BR% Sierra (10.12.x), %BR% and High Sierra (10.13.x); %BR% expected to be fully compatible with Mojave (10.14.x)  |


Also troublesome, Apple bundles only "dylib" files, while Microsoft and others depend on "Frameworks" versions of these libraries.

== Enabling Web Queries in Microsoft Excel ==

This takes just a few steps on your Mac.

# **Update Microsoft Office**, which you can do through the Excel **HELP** menu, "**Check for Updates**."  Repeat this step until no more updates are found.  (Office 2011 14.1.2 is the earliest version compatible with OS X Lion or later.  We recommend applying all available Office updates, for both Office 2011 and Office 2016.)%BR%
