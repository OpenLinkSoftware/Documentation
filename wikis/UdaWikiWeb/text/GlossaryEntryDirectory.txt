The Directory parameter appears in the [generic] sections of your <nop>OpenLink Session Rules Book. A corresponding Directory field appears in the Administrative Assistant's Database Agent Settings Form and Wizard. If you move your database agent from the /bin sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink installation, you must pass its new path to Directory. 

Example: {{{Directory = tmp }}}
