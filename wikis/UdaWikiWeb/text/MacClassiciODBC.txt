===Linking iODBC and ODBC Applications on Mac OS===

====Mac OS Classic====

The Mac OS SDK package ships as a compressed Macintosh format (.sit, .hqx). After uncompressing it on your hard drive, you will find the following iODBC SDK directory structure or tree installed on Mac OS Classic :

iODBC comprises three parts. Each one has its proper set of include files and libraries:

* The iODBC Driver Manager - Its main task is to load the right ODBC driver and run functions appropriate to that driver.
    
* The iODBC Configuration Manager - Its main task is to access and manage the DSN configuration files.
    
* The iODBC GUI Manager - Its main task is to give to the user the ability to access all ODBC functionality through a GUI.

Under the include directory, you will find all the iODBC header files that can be used in your source. The main header files are: isql.h, isqlext.h, isqltypes.h, iodbcadm.h, iodbcinst.h

The aformentioned files generally serve as proxies for other header files provided in the same directory: sql.h, sqlext.h, sqltypes.h, odbcinst.h

To access all these include files, simply add to your compiler an include path that points to iODBC/include. This is compiler dependent, so you may have to look into your compiler's documentation. For Code Warrior, you can do this via the Project Preferences panel.

Under the lib directory, you will find all the iODBC libraries needed to link against your application. All of the above mentioned components are shipped in three different forms: CFM shared library, static object file, and static object file with debugging information.

You have to link your application with only one set of libraries. If you choose the CFM shared library set, ensure that at runtime these files are in the System-Extensions folder of your Mac Classic system.

To access the right set of library files, add a library path that points to iODBC/lib. This is compiler dependent. Consult your compiler documentation. For Code Warrior, you can do this through the Project Preferences panel.
