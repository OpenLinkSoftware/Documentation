===Output of java commands===

# Insure that the {{{java}}} command returns driver version information. Failure to return version information may show an incompatibility or environment problem.
# Insure that successful driver version information matches the expected driver name and version.
# Check available resources to see if the driver version is associated with limitations, bugs, or other known issues. Bugzilla is the best point of reference for <nop>OpenLink JDBC drivers.
# Compare Multi-Tier JDBC client {{{java}}} output with Request Broker Version and Database Agent Version strings. Differing client and server versions create compatibility and stability problems. 
# Insure you have java version 1.5 or greater in any environment where <nop>OpenLink Express Edition drivers are deployed.
