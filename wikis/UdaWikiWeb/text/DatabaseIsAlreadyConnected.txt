===Database <database> is already connected. (1012)===

The "database already connected error" suggests that you have tried to connect to the same database twice. However, you have not terminated the first connection to that database. Alternatively, your application may have issued a disconnect for the first connection. However, that disconnect may have been deferred.

To resolve this issue, I need additional resources. First, please supply an <nop>OpenLink Session Rules Book. I need to insure that your database agent <nop>ReUse is Never. I must also determine whether or not tableview is enforced. Use of both Tableview and {{{ReUse=Never}}} have resolved this problem, in the past. Additionally, please send a clientside ODBC trace. The trace may reveal additional factors contributing to this matter.
