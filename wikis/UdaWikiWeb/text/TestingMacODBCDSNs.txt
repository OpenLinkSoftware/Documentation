= Testing ODBC DSNs on Mac OS X, with iODBCTest =

This is a simple 'C' based and ODBC compliant Interactive SQL processor.
# Launch iODBCTest by double-clicking the {{{iODBC Test.command}}} script found in {{{/Applications/iODBC/}}}.  Alternatively, you can open a Terminal session, and execute this command:
{{{
"/Applications/iODBC/iODBC Test.command"
}}}
# When prompted for a connect string, you can enter "?" to see a list of ODBC DSNs on your machine, or immediately enter a valid ODBC Connect String following the form --
{{{
DSN=<dsn name>[;UID=<username>[;PWD=<password>]][;<connect string attribute>=<value>]
}}}
If you have an Oracle DSN named "Marketing", you might enter:
{{{
DSN=Marketing;UID=scott;PWD=tiger
}}}
#* Note: If there is a username but no password, you must include a semicolon at the end:
{{{
DSN=Marketing;UID=sa;PWD=;
}}}
# Once connected, any valid SQL or ODBC command may be executed through this interface. You can also call on several built-in functions, which interrogate the back-end for --
#* {{{datatypes}}}
#* {{{owners}}}
#* {{{qualifiers}}}
#* {{{tables}}}
#* {{{types}}}
# The following example shows a connection to Microsoft SQL Server 2000, making a simple query against the sample Northwind database:
