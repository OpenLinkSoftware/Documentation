= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Lite Edition (Single-Tier) JDBC Driver for ODBC Data Sources (a/k/a JDBC-to-ODBC Bridge), for Mac OS X = 

== DBMS Requirements ==

* Your target data source must be SQL compliant. 
* You must possess enough knowledge to establish a ODBC connection to this database using third-party or native ODBC drivers. 

== Software Requirements==

* You must possess **third-party or native ODBC drivers** that connect to your target database. A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition JDBC Driver for ODBC Data Sources.
* You must have a **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** that is compatible with <nop>OpenLink software.  (All Java software shipped by Apple and installed as part of Mac OS X is compatible. The JRE is part of the default Mac OS X installation.)

== Configuration Requirements==

* The third-party or native ODBC driver must successfully connect to the target database. For best results, at least one System DSN should be defined to make such connections. <nop>OpenLink Product Support can provide minimal assistance in this area.
* You must know the exact name of the DSN(s), or know the complete ODBC Connect String, that connects to the target data source.
