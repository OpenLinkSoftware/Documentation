= Error Message: <code><nop>OpenLink Communications Line Broken</code> =

"<nop>OpenLink Communications Line Broken" errors may occur under a variety of circumstances. To resolve these, try the following:

# Confirm that your ODBC DSN targets the correct Broker Listen port. This is the port on which your <nop>OpenLink Request Broker listens, as specified by the {{{Listen}}} keyword in the {{{[Protocol TCP]}}} stanza of the Broker Rulebook ({{{oplrqb.ini}}} by default). The default value is 5000. 
#* Do not use port 8000, unless you deliberately configured the Request Broker -- not the Admin Assistant -- to listen on 8000. 
#* Do not use the port at which your actual database listens. %BR%
# Review the Broker Log for any reported errors. If the client-side error can be predictably recreated, restart the Broker in DEBUG mode (e.g., <code>oplrqb +debug</code>), and trigger the error while watching stdout.  Report any error messages you observe here, especially if they are not preserved in the Broker log.%BR%
# Check your network for extended intermittent failures.%BR%
