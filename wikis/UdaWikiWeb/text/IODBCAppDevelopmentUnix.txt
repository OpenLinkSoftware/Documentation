====Developing ODBC Applications====

The ODBC SDK only implements an interface for the 'C' programming language. To write an ODBC application, you must perform the following tasks:

1. Include the files "sql.h" and "sqlext.h" in your 'C' program(s).

2. Link the application with the following libraries:

{{{
      lib/libiodbc.a
      lib/libiodbc.so
}}}

3. At runtime, include these libraries in your shared library path:

{{{
      libiodbc.so.2.1.2
      libiodbc.so.2
}}}

4. Compile the program in the same directory as the "Makefile" file. Using this syntax:

{{{
      make
}}}

Note: Some UNIX systems also need -lsocket, -lnsl_s or both.
