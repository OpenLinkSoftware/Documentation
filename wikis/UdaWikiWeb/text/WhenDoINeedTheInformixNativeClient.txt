==When do I need the Informix native client?==

There are two scenarios in which you would require the Informix native client. You must install the Informix client on the same machine as any Informix Single-Tier driver. Additionally, you must install the Informix client on the same machine as <nop>OpenLink's Multi-Tier Request Broker and Informix Database Agent, if the Broker and Informix Agent do not reside on the same machine as the Informix database.
