"{{{User does not have permission to use one of the flags given. (-34000)}}}" is a permissions error that may occur when users attempt to query Ingres databases.  Typically, this error indicates that the Multi-Tier server-side components (Request Broker and Database Agent) are not running as the Ingres owning user.

To resolve this problem, take the following action:

# Log in to the machine that contains your Multi-Tier server components.
# Type '{{{bash}}}' or '{{{sh}}}' to open a Bash or Bourne shell.
# Navigate to the main directory of your Multi-Tier installation.
# Execute the following commands: 
{{{
. ./openlink.sh
oplrqb -fy
}}}
# Use {{{chmod}}} to enable your Ingres user to run {{{oplrqb}}}.
# Use {{{chmod}}} to enable your Ingres user to read {{{oplrqb.ini}}}.
# Use {{{chmod}}} to enable your Ingres user to write to {{{oplrqb.log}}}.
# Run this command: 
{{{
cd ..
}}}
# Use {{{chmod}}} to enable your Ingres user to execute {{{openlink.sh}}}.
# {{{su}}} to your Ingres user.
# Set the Ingres user's environment, typically with 
{{{
. ./.profile
}}}
# Navigate to the root of your Multi-Tier installation, and execute these commands:
{{{
. ./openlink.sh
oplrqb +debug
}}}
# Test.
# After all is confirmed to be working, ctrl-C to terminate the DEBUG mode Broker, and then restart as usual.
