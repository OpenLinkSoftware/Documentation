# Simply download the .dll and place it in the folder from which your .NET application runs.

No additional configuration is involved, if you installed the DLL to a standard location. 

The directory containing the DLL must either be the same as that from which the .NET application runs, or the directory's path must be included in the active Global Assembly Cache environment variable setting.

* **Provider Name**: {{{OpenLink.Data.OdbcClient.dll}}}
