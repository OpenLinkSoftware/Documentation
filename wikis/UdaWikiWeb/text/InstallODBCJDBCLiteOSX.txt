# You will be shown a graphical progress bar as the Installation progresses, followed by System Optimization.
# After the driver has been installed, you will be prompted to locate a license file.%BR%%BR%
//**NOTE** -- If a correctly named file already exists in {{{$OPL_LICENSE_DIR}}}, {{{/Library/Application Support/openlink/bin/}}}, you will not see this dialog.  If the existing file is not valid (evaluation has expired, it's for a different OS, it permits insufficient processor cores, etc.), you will need to [[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/ApplyingLicenseFiles| manually apply a valid license file]] after installation is completed.//%BR%%BR%
//**NOTE** -- In some environments, this dialog may be hidden by the Installer.app or other windows on your Mac.  Please minimize, hide, and/or move windows until you can see and act on this dialog.  If you do not answer this dialog, the installation will not complete properly, and the driver will not function as desired.//%BR%%BR%
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Selectlicense.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* If a license file already exists on the machine, select the 'use existing' option. (Previously generated license files may be [[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/ODSBriefcaseLicenseStorage| re-downloaded from your ODS-Briefcase data space]].)%BR%%BR%
#* If you need to obtain a new trial or permanent license file, select the 'try or buy' option, which will load a relevant web page from which you can obtain a license file.%BR%%BR%
# When the process is complete, you will be told that the software was successfully installed. Click "Close" and the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for JDBC Data Sources is ready for use.

== Configuration ==

To configure an ODBC DSN, run the <nop>OpenLink iODBC Administrator located in the /Applications/iODBC folder:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/OJDBC_iODBC.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the System DSN tab:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/OJDBC_System.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the Add button. Then, select the <nop>OpenLink   JDBC Lite Driver from the list of available drivers. Select the Unicode version of the driver **if and only if** you are working with multi-byte character sets, as unnecessary translations can significantly affect ODBC performance:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/OJDBC_Available.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click Finish.
# The Data Source tab prompts a Data Source Name and optional description. 
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/OJDBC_DSNName.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click Continue.
# The Connection Tab takes the minimum requirements that are necessary to connect to your JDBC data source.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ORA_ConnTab.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **JDBC Driver** - The class name for your third-party JDBC driver, e.g., {{{virtuoso.jdbc3.Driver}}}
#* **URL String** - The JDBC connection URL for your third-party JDBC driver
#* **Username** - The username for your JDBC database
# The Options tab displays additional parameters that can be configured for the connection.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/OJDBC_Options.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Row Buffer Size** - The number of records to be transported over the network in a single network hop. Values can range from 1 to 99.
#* **Hide Login Dialog** - Suppresses the ODBC "Username" and "Password" login dialog boxes when interacting with your ODBC DSN from within an ODBC compliant application.
#* **Read Only connection** - Specifies whether the connection is "Read-only." Make sure the checkbox is unchecked to request a "Read/Write" connection.
#* **Drop Catalog from Meta calls** - Enable this option to have the catalog name not appear for tables, views, and procedures when requesting database meta-data.
#* **Drop Schema from Meta calls** - Enable this option to have the schema name not appear for tables, views, and procedures when requesting database meta-data.
#* **No support of quoted identifier** - If set, the call <nop>SQLGetInfo for '{{{SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR}}}' will return a space (" "). It can be used if the DBMS doesn't support quoted SQL like {{{SELECT * from "account"}}}
#* **SQLStatistics disabled** -  Check this box to have {{{SQLStatistics()}}} return an empty result set. Use this if the underlying database does not support retrieval of statistics about a table (e.g. what indexes it has).
#*  **No support of search string escape** - If set, the call {{{SQLGetInfo(SQL_LIKE_ESCAPE_CLAUSE)}}} will return a space (" "). It can be used if the DBMS doesn't support SQL escape patterns.
#* **Patch of {{{NULL}}} size of {{{SQL_CHAR}}}** -  If set, this option overrides the size of {{{SQL_CHAR}}} column type returned by the database with the value set in the text box (in bytes). With a default value of 0, the driver uses the size returned by the database.
#* **{{{SQL_DBMS}}} Name** - Manually overrides the {{{SQLGetInfo(SQL_DBMS_NAME)}}} response returned by the driver. This is required for products like Microsoft <nop>InfoPath (for which the value should be "SQL Server").
# Click Continue to view additional preferences that can be set for the connection.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/OJDBC_Preferences.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Initialization SQL** - Lets you specify a file containing SQL statements that will be run automatically against the database upon connection.
#* **Cursor Sensitivity** - Enables or disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library calculates check-sums for each row in the current rowset and compares these with the check-sums (if any) already stored in the row version cache for the same rows when fetched previously. If the check-sums differ for a row, the row has been updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to {{{SQL_ROW_UPDATED}}}. The row version cache is then updated with the latest check-sums for the rowset. From the user's point of view, the only visible difference between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status flag can never be set to {{{SQL_ROW_UPDATED}}} when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as {{{SQL_ROW_SUCCESS}}}.) In all other respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same. Deleted rows don't appear in the rowset. Updates to the row since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in the rowset, if their keys fall within the span of the rowset. If your application does not need to detect the row status {{{SQL_ROW_UPDATED}}}, you should leave the 'High Cursor Sensitivity' checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of check-sums for each row fetched carries an overhead. Before enabling this option, the table {{{oplrvc}}} must be created using the appropriate script for the target database.
#* **Max Rows Override** - Allows you to define a limit on the maximum number of rows to be returned from a query. The default value of 0 means no limit.
#* **Disable <nop>AutoCommit** - Changes the default commit behavior of the <nop>OpenLink driver. The default mode is <nop>AutoCommit (box unchecked).
#* **Disable Rowset Size Limit** - Disables a limitation enforced by the cursor library. This limitation is enforced by default. It prevents the driver from claiming all available memory in the event that a result set  generated from an erroneous query is very large. The limit is not normally reached.
#* **Defer fetching of long data** - Defers fetching of {{{LONG}}} ({{{BINARY}}}, {{{BLOB}}}, etc.) data unless explicitly requested in a query. This can provides significant performance increases when fields in query do not include {{{LONG}}} data fields.
#* **Multiple Active Statements Emulation** - Enables use of Multiple Active Statements in an ODBC application even if the underlying database does not allow this, as it is emulated in the driver.
# Click the Finish button to save your new Data Source Name.
