===Table Schema===

The table schema contains a complete list of fields which appear in a table. The schema also contains metadata pertaining to these fields. Here, you will find data types, descriptions, precision, default values, and other field information. 

Your table schema may appear as a part of your database documentation. If you do not have an explicit schema, provide the create table statement which was used to create your table. If you do not have this statement, determine if your database will allow you to dump your table definition information.
