=Error Message: {{{There is no server for database DBNAME. (1423)}}}===

"There is no server for database DBNAME" errors typically occur when the specified database is not running. 

Ensure that your Progress database has been started. 

"There is no server" errors may also occur: 

* If you pass incorrect values for the {{{-S -H -N}}} sockets parameters
{{{
-S ServiceNameOrPortNumber -H hostname.fqdn.or.IP -N tcp
}}}
* If you pass an incorrect database path or misspell the database name. For best results, we advise using the full path to your Progress database, and including the {{{.db}}} extension on the end of the database name. For example:
{{{
/dbs/progress/dbs/demo.db
}}}


If "There is no server" errors persist, relink your Multi-Tier Progress database agent, or try using a sockets-based connection.
