%BR%
<nop>OpenLink's ODBC Lite and Generic ODBC drivers perform a special function. These drivers enable you to establish ODBC connections to databases, for which <nop>OpenLink does not provide a database-specific driver or database agent. To proceed, you must possess native or 3rd-party ODBC drivers that connect to your database. Then, you must install <nop>OpenLink's ODBC Lite drivers on the machine which contains these drivers. Alternatively, you must install the Multi-Tier (MT) Request Broker and Generic ODBC Agent on the machine, which contains these drivers. You may then install the Multi-Tier client on any supported operating system. %BR%
