== <nop>OpenLink Single-tier Components (*nix) for <nop>DB2==

=== Aims and Intentions=== 

This guide is intended to enable competent system administrators to install and configure <nop>OpenLink Multi-tier client side components on *nix style operating systems in a few steps as possible.

This guide does not explain any of the non-pertinent features encountered along the way. Such explanations may be found in the full documentation.

===Prerequisites===

* You **MUST** be proficient in using a Unix shell.
* You **MUST** be proficient in using a Unix editor such as vi
* You **MUST** be in possession of relevant database connectivity details such as Database name, Username, password, etc.
* You **MUST** have installed, and available; a full installation of <nop>DB2, <nop>DB2 Client or <nop>DB2 Connect.

===Installation===

# Log onto the machine and create a suitable <nop>OpenLink installation directory &lt;<nop>OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;%BR%
# Copy all relevant components to &lt;<nop>OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;%BR%%BR% At bare minimum, these will be the <nop>OpenLink ODBC Driver for <nop>DB2, <nop>OpenLink Http Administration Assistant%BR% and <nop>OpenLink license file.%BR%
# Install using the "install.sh" shell script --
{{{
 #sh install.sh

}}}
# You should take care to enter correct information when prompted pertaining to ports, passwords, etc and ensure that you note these down for future use.%BR%
# The installation should finish without error.

===Configuration===
====Environment====
Open the file &lt;<nop>OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;/openlink.sh with a suitable text editor such as vi.%BR%
Locate the section that deals with the location of shared libraries pertaining to your system (LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LIBPATH or SHLIB_PATH) and add to it the location of your <nop>DB2 lib directory --
{{{
 
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH="&lt;OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;/lib:/home/db2inst1/sqllib/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
  
}}}
====Driver Specific====
Open the file &lt;<nop>OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;/openlink.ini with a suitable text editor such as vi.%BR%
Locate the [Environment <nop>DB2] section that deals with the driver specific <nop>DB2 configuration and edit to reflect your <nop>DB2 installation --
{{{
 
 [Environment DB2]
 DB2DIR             = /usr/opt/db2_08_01
 DB2INSTANCE        = db2inst1   ; default instance
 CURSOR_SENSITIVITY = LOW        ; Set to HIGH after loading oplrvc.sql

}}}
====Data Souce====
Open the file &lt;<nop>OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;/bin/odbc.ini with a suitable text editor such as vi.%BR%
Locate and edit the sample <nop>OpenLink DB2 ODBC data source (DSN) created during the installation process and edit as follows

====Sample DB2 Data Source-====
{{{
 
 [db2]
 Driver          = &lt;OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;/lib/oplodbc.so
 ServerType      = DB2
 Database        = test
 Username        = db2inst1
 Password        = **********
 FetchBufferSize = 99
 ReadOnly        = no
 DeferLongFetch  = no
 JetFix          = no
 Description     = Sample DB2 DSN

}}}

===Testing===
Use the {{{iodbctest}}} tool which is packaged with the HTTP-based <nop>OpenLink ODBC Administrator as follows -- 
{{{
 
 #cd &lt;OPENLINK_INSTALL&gt;
 #. ./openLink.sh
 # iodbctest db2
 iODBC Demonstration program
 This program shows an interactive SQL processor
 Driver Manager: 03.52.0507.0105
 Driver: 06.02.1217 OpenLink Generic ODBC Driver (oplodbc.so) 

 SQL>

}}}

You should now be able to issue <nop>SQL statements directly against the target database.

====Additional Information====

* The bitness of the ODBC Driver for <nop>DB2 is determined by the bitness of your ODBC client application.%BR%%BR%That is, if your ODBC client application is 32-bit then the Generic ODBC Driver component **MUST** also be 32-bit.
