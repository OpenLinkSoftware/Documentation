=Error message: {{{Access denied for user 'username'@'hostname' (Using password: YES) (1045)}}} =

This error occurs when 
* a <nop>MySQL server gets an incorrect password for the username specified, <i>or</i> 
* the correct password is provided, but the user hasn't been granted access from the specific client host.

This is a common error, as <nop>MySQL access is restricted by client host combined with the username &amp; password credentials, and access has to be specifically granted as detailed in the [[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/access-denied.html|MySQL documentation]].
