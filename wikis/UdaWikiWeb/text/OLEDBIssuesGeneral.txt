= Known Issues with the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition OLE DB Provider for ODBC Data Sources -- General =

* This Provider does not allow a consumer application to dynamically specify server-side cursors. ADO consumers (e.g., [[OLEDBIssuesVB6|Visual Basic 6]] and [[OLEDBIssuesInterdev6|Visual Interdev 6]]) should use client-side cursors.
    
* Batched commands are not supported.
