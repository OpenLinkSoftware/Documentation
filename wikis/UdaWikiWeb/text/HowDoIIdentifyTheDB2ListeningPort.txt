== Identify the DB2 Listening Port == 

=== Identify the DB2 database listening port on Windows===

1. Login to the DB2 DBMS server.

2. Launch the DB2 Control Center.

3. Right-click the target instance.

4. Click Setup Communications.

5. The port number appears in the Properties window.   


=== Identify the DB2 database listening port on Unix===  
 
**Method 1: {{{/etc/services}}} ** 

1. Login to the machine that hosts the DB2 DBMS.

2. vi the {{{/etc/services}}} file.   

{{{
vi /etc/services
}}}
 
3. Locate the socket service associated with your target database.

4. Identify the port number associated with the socket service.  

**Method 2: get instance ** 
  
 
1. Login to the machine that hosts the DB2 DBMS.

2. su to your db2 instance owner. For example:

{{{
su db2instance1
}}}
 

3. Execute the .profile associated with the db2 instance owner. For example:

{{{
. ./.profile
}}}
 

4. cd into the $DB2INSTANCE/sqllib/bin directory.

{{{
cd $DB2INSTANCE/sqllib/bin
}}}
 

5. Execute the db2 command.

{{{
./db2
}}}
 

6. Use the //get instance// option to get the current instance name.

{{{
get instance
}}}

7. Use //get dbm cfg// command to identify the socket service name. 

{{{
get dbm cfg l grep SVCE    # Example uses an "l" instead of a pipe due to limitations in markup display. 
}}}

8. Look for output similar to the following where db2inst64 is the service name:

{{{
TCP/IP Service name          (SVCENAME) = db2inst64
}}}
 

9. Use the db2 interface to grep the /etc/services file for the service name listed above. For example:

{{{
grep db2inst64 /etc/services
}}}
 

10. Look for output similar to the following:

{{{
db2inst64   50012/tcp   # Connection port for DB2 instance instance
}}}
