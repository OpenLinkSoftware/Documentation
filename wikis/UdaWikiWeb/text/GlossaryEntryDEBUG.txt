DEBUG is a Request Broker log detail setting. It appears in the Administrative Assistant's Edit Request Broker's Parameters Form and Wizard. If you set your Broker's log detail to DEBUG, the Broker will write highly informative, connection-related information to it's log file. DEBUG is the maximum log detail setting. 

This setting is optimal for diagnostic purposes.
