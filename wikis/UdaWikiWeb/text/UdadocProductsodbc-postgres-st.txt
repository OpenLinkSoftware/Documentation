The Single-Tier ODBC Drivers for [[PostgreSQL]]  conform to the common architectural perceptions of an ODBC driver -- a single component installed on a desktop, workstation, or application server machine. 

The [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier Drivers for [[PostgreSQL]]  are a Type B class of driver developed using the [[PostgreSQL]]  network (wire) protocol interface eliminating the need for the installation of any [[PostgreSQL]]  specific client networking software. 

The drivers are currently available for [[PostgreSQL]]  versions 6.x, 7.x and beyond.
