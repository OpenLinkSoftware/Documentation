==Mapping Rules==

The Mapping Rules are the cornerstone of <nop>OpenLink security. These rules are set in the [Mapping Rules] section of the <nop>OpenLink Session Rules Book. You will also find the Rules in the Administrative Assistant's Session Rules Editor.   

Each Mapping Rule is composed of 7 parameters. They represent domain, database, user, opsys, machine, application, and access mode aliases, respectively. To create a rule, you simply input the appropriate values or regular expressions into the fields which you want to filter. The following rule allows anyone to connect to the backend database:   

{{{
*;*;*;*;*;*;* = accept generic_ora8   
}}

The following rule prohibits user scott from connecting to the backend database:   

{{{
*;*;scott;*;*;*;* = reject generic_ora8   
}}}

The following rule combination allows scott to connect to the database, if and only if he uses Microsoft Access in READ-ONLY mode: 

{{{
*;*;scott;*;*;msaccess;ro = accept generic_ora8 *;*;scott;*;*;*;* = reject generic_ora8   
}}}

As you can see, Mapping Rules provide you with a flexible and convenient way to build your security logic. For additional informational on the creation of Mapping Rules, consult your documentation.
