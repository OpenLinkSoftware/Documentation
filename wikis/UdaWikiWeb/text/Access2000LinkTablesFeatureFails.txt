===Access 2000 Link Tables Feature Fails===

If you cannot link tables into Access 2000, check your MDAC version. Early MDAC 2.1 builds possess a bug that prohibits this operation.

To determine your MDAC version, take the following action:

1. Open your ODBC Data Sources utility (Control Panel). 

2. Click on the "About" tab. 

3. Locate your Driver Manager in the list box.

4. Find the version number that corresponds to your Driver Manager.

If your Driver Manager version is less than 3.510.4202.2, you need to upgrade. Go to microsoft.com and download the latest components, which are appropriate for your machine:

Be advised - If you upgrade your MDAC components, upgrade your Microsoft Jet Engine components to ensure compatibility.
