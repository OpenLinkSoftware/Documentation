==== DBMS Requirements ====

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target Sybase DBMS instance and database:

* [[HowDoIFindMySybaseInstanceName|Sybase instance name]]
* [[HowDoIFindMySybaseListenPort|Sybase listen port]]
* Sybase database name
* Sybase database server hostname or IP address

==== Software Requirements ====

*  There are no software requirements associated with use of <nop>OpenLink's Sybase database agent and Request Broker on Mac OS X.

==== Configuration Requirements ====

* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are in use on the local OSX machine. These ports are used by <nop>OpenLink's Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. You will need to allocate different ports for these two services during installation.
