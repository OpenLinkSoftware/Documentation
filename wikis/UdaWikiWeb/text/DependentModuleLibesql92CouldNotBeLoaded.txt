=Dependent module libesql92.so could not be loaded=

This error occurs when Progress native library <code>libesql92.so</code> is not present or cannot be located on the local operating system. 

Ensure that **Progress SQL-92 Client Access** or a **full Progress DBMS** is installed. 

Then, ensure that the relevant library path (<code><nowiki>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</nowiki></code>, <code>LIBPATH</code>, <code><nowiki>SHLIB_PATH</nowiki></code>) contains <code><nowiki>$DLC/lib</nowiki></code>, i.e., the library sub-directory of the local Progress installation. 

The relevant library variable should be set on the command-line before any services associated with <nop>OpenLink are started. It should also be set in the Single-Tier <code>openlink.ini</code> file or Multi-Tier <code>oprlqb.ini</code> file. Both of these files appear in the bin sub-directory of the relevant product installation.
