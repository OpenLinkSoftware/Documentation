= Error Message: {{{The installer could not find any packages (.taz) to install.}}} =

This message typically indicates that you downloaded the installation archives using Internet Explorer, or some other browser which "helpfully" renamed the archives with different file extensions.

Our installation script only operates on archives with the file extensions as we created them -- i.e., <code>something.taz</code>.  

If your download tool changed the names to <code>something.tgz</code> or <code>something.taz.tgz</code> or anything else, all you need do is change the names back to their originals.
