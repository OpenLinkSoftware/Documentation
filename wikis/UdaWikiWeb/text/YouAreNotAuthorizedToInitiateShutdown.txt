= UDA Error Message: {{{You are not authorized to initiate shutdown}}} =

Take the following action to rectify this problem.

# Open your Broker Rulebook ({{{oplrqb.ini}}} by default) in a text editor (vi, emacs, TextEdit, BBEdit, Notepad, Wordpad, etc.).
# Locate the {{{[Request Broker]}}} section.
# Locate the {{{HostNameResolver}}} parameter.
# Ensure that there are no semicolons in front of {{{HostNameResolver}}}.
# Set {{{HostNameResolver=No}}}, as --
{{{
[Request Broker]
...
HostNameResolver = No
}}}
# Locate the {{{[Security]}}} section.
# Ensure there are no semicolons in front of {{{ShutdownBy}}} and {{{ShutdownFrom}}}.
# Confirm that the user issuing the shutdown command (e.g., {{{george}}}), and the hostname and/or IP address of the machine from which they're issuing the shutdown command (typically the Broker host itself; e.g., broker-host, broker-host.example.com, 192.168.123.234), are respectively found in the {{{ShutdownBy}}} (username) and {{{ShutdownFrom}}} (hostname, IP address) values. Note that regex is active on these values, so you must escape the dot-separators in IP addresses and host names.
{{{
[Security]
StartupBy = root, george
ShutdownBy = root, george
ShutdownFrom = arthur, arthur\.example\.com, 192\.168\.123\.234, localhost, 127\.0\.0\.1
}}}
You may wish to test with these set to wildcard values, but note that this is a potential security issue which may enable Denial Of Service and other attacks.
{{{
[Security]
StartupBy = *, .*
ShutdownBy = *, .*
ShutdownFrom = *, .*
}}}
# Save your changes.
# Force-quit the Request Broker, using the Process Manager on Windows, {{{kill}}} command on Unix, or similar techniques.  Confirm that the process has been terminated before proceeding.
# Launch your Request Broker.
# Test a friendly Broker shutdown, using {{{oplshut}}}, Services control panel on Windows, etc.
{{{
. ./openlink.sh
oplshut -fy
}}}
# Confirm that the error has been resolved.
