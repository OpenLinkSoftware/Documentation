=Identify the Progress SQL mode (i.e., SQL-89 or SQL-92) =

Progress 8.x and earlier can only run in SQL-89 mode.  Progress <nop>OpenEdge 10.x and later can only run in SQL-92 mode.

Progress 9.x has a hybrid engine that can run in either SQL-89 or SQL-92 mode, or both.  Use the following steps to learn which mode your Progress 9.x instance is running in.

# Log in to your Progress DBMS server.
# Locate the database log file. Typically, the log file should have the same name as the database {{{.db}}} file, but with an {{{.lg}}} extension; e.g., the {{{sports92.db}}} file will typically have a corresponding {{{sports92.lg}}} file.
# Make a copy of the database log file.
# Open the copy with a text editor.
# Locate the section corresponding to the most recent database startup.
# Look for a line similar to this:
{{{
11:50:04 BROKER  0: This broker supports both 4GL and SQL server groups. (8865)
}}}
Reference to 4GL indicates SQL-89 mode. Reference to SQL indicates SQL-92 mode. Reference to both is referred to as "mixed" mode.
