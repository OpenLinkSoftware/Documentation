= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition ODBC Driver for Progress/<nop>OpenEdge, for Unix-like OS =

%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements ==

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target Progress/<nop>OpenEdge database:

* [[HowCanITellIfProgressIsRunningInSocketsOrSharedMemory|The Progress Startup Mode (Sockets or Shared Memory)]]
#* The Single-Tier driver cannot connect over Shared Memory, so you may need to [[RestartProgressInSocketsMode|restart your Progress database in sockets mode]]
#* Once running in Sockets mode, you need to know [[HowCanIFindMyProgressDatabaseTcpSocketDefinition|the TCP socket service name and/or port number]]
* [[HowCanITellIfProgressIsRunningInSQL89OrSQL92Mode|The Progress SQL Engine Capabilities at Startup (4GL, SQL, Both)]]
#* Progress 8 and earlier engines only support 4GL, and you can only use our SQL-89 drivers
#* Progress 9 engines support both 4GL and SQL, and you can use either our SQL-89 or SQL-92 drivers
#* <nop>OpenEdge 10 and later engines only support SQL, and you can only use our SQL-92 drivers
* Your Progress database server's [[HowCanIFindMyProgressDatabaseTcpSocketDefinition|hostname or IP address]]
* Whether or not your database queries fire 4GL triggers (primarily a concern for SQL-89 connections)
* Whether or not your database queries involve Array fields (primarily a concern for SQL-89 connections)

== Software Requirements ==

# **Progress Client layer** 
|  *To connect to this DBMS Version*  |  *You need these components ...*  |  *...on the same host as these*  |
|  Progress 8.x or earlier  |  //Progress&#174; Client Networking//  |  SQL-89 Lite Drivers  |
|  Progress 9.x in SQL-89 or 4GL mode  |  //Progress&#174; Client Networking//  |  SQL-89 Lite Drivers  |
|  Progress 9.x in SQL-92 mode  |  //Progress&#174; SQL-92 Client Access//  |  SQL-92 Lite Drivers  |
|  Progress <nop>OpenEdge 10.x or later  |  //Progress&#174; SQL-92 Client Access//  |  SQL-92 Lite Drivers  |
#* The //Progress&#174; Client Networking// or //Progress&#174; SQL-92 Client Access// must be licensed from Progress Software. <nop>OpenLink Software cannot provide such licenses.
#* Installers for //Progress&#174; Client Networking// or //Progress&#174; SQL-92 Client Access// must be obtained from your Progress distribution media or the Progress Web site. <nop>OpenLink Software cannot provide such installers.
# **SQL-89 vs SQL-92**
#* The SQL-89 drivers are Progress version-specific, with names like <i>Multi-Threaded ODBC Driver for Progress 9.1D</i> or <i>Single-Threaded ODBC Driver for Progress 8.3E</i>. These drivers offer support for Progress triggers, Progress Distributed Databases (i.e., connections to multiple databases over a single ODBC connection), our specialized tableview configuration, and a particular presentation of Progress array data familiar to the Progress community.  SQL-92 drivers, which all specify "(SQL-92)" in their name, do not support SQL-89/4GL functionality.  
#* The SQL-92 drivers have a more generic branding such as <i>Multi-Threaded ODBC Driver for Progress 9.1 (SQL-92)</i>.  These drivers enable SQL-92 queries against Progress 9.x and later, including <nop>OpenEdge 10.x and later.  SQL-89 drivers, which all specify a "letter" version of Progress (e.g., 8.3C, 9.1B) do not support SQL-92 functionality.  
# **32-bit vs 64-bit**
#* 32-bit Progress Clients can only be used with 32-bit Single-Tier drivers, which can only be used with 32-bit client applications.
#* 64-bit Progress Clients can only be used with 64-bit Single-Tier drivers, which can only be used with 64-bit client applications.
#* If your components do not all match "bitness," open a Support Case for assistance in selecting the best path forward, e.g., 
#*# If available, getting the Progress Client of the required "bitness";
#*# If available, getting a client application of the required "bitness"; or
#*# If the bitness-matched Progress Client and ODBC client application do not exist, changing to a [[http://uda.openlinksw.com/odbc-progress-mt/|bitness-bridging ODBC driver]].

== Configuration Requirements ==

* Ensure Progress's <code>[[SetDLCPROCFGonUnix|DLC]]</code> and <code>[[SetDLCPROCFGonUnix|PROCFG]]</code> environment variables are set.
* Ensure relevant shared library environment variable(s) (<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, <code>SHLIB_PATH</code>, and/or <code>LIBPATH</code>, depending on specific OS) include Progress library directories.
