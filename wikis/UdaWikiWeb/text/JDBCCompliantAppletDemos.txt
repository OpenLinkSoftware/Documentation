= Testing JDBC Connections =

Some sample JDBC applets are bundled with our JDBC Drivers. Each one demonstrates practical use of JDBC and highlights <nop>OpenLink-specific functionality. These demos reside in the {{{.../samples/jdbc/jdk1*}}} sub-directories of the <nop>OpenLink installation. Each applet is accessible from the <nop>OpenLink Admin Assistant (an <nop>OpenLink agent that provides HTTP services like any Web Server does).

* [[JDBCDemoApplet|JDBCDemo]] demonstrates basic JDBC functionality.

* [[ScrollDemoApplet|ScrollDemo]] demonstrates the additional Resultset navigation functionality provided by our Scrollable Resultset & <nop>RowSet Extensions for JDBC on a Record-by-Record Basis.

* [[ScrollDemo2Applet|ScrollDemo2]] demonstrates the additional Resultset navigation functionality provided by JDBC 2.0.

* [[RowSetDemoApplet|RowSetDemo]] demonstrates the additional Resultset navigation functionality provided by our Scrollable Resultset & <nop>RowSet Extensions for JDBC on a <nop>RowSet-by-<nop>RowSet Basis.
