== Installation==

# The <nop>OpenLink Generic ODBC Driver for Mac OS X is distributed as a Disk Image (.dmg) file:  
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_DMGFile.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Double-click the disk image to extract the installer .mpkg file:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/GENERIC_MPKG.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# You will encounter a warning message that will ask you if you are sure that you want to install the software. Click Continue:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Warning.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# This is the **Welcome** dialog for the <nop>OpenLink Generic ODBC Driver:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Welcome.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Review the **Read Me** file for installation requirements and known issues:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Readme.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Read the **Software License Agreement** before continuing your installation:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Agreement.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Agree to the terms set forth in the license:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Agree.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Select a destination volume for the driver installation:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Destination.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Choose to perform a custom or default installation of the driver:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Easy.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# If you chose the custom option, select which of the following components to install:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Custom.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Note: The software must be installed as a user with Administrative privileges on the machine:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Authenticate.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# The installation is complete:

== Configuration ==

# To configure an ODBC DSN, run the <nop>OpenLink iODBC Administrator located in the /Applications/iODBC folder:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_iODBC.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the Add button that appears on the System DSN tab.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_System.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Then, select the <nop>OpenLink Generic ODBC Driver v6.0 from the list of available drivers. Select the Unicode version of the driver **if and only if** you are working with multi-byte character sets, as unnecessary translations can significantly affect ODBC performance:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Available.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Provide a suitable DSN name and optional description for the Data Source:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_DSNName.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click the "Manual settings..." link in the Server field and specify the host name and port on which the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker listens. 
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Host.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click OK to exit the host and port dialog. Click Continue to proceed.
# The Connection tab takes the minimum parameters required to make a connection to the target database:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Connection.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Domain** - The value must match a [Domain Alias], which is contained in the Server's Session Rules Book. This Alias typically represents the name and version of an <nop>OpenLink Agent. That agent version may differ from the DBMS version to which it connects. Note that advanced users may create custom domain names that follow their own, desired conventions.   
#* **Name** - May take several settings, depending on the Domain -- database name, JDBC driver classname, Oracle SID, etc.  Displayed text entry field name will generally change appropriately.
#* **Server** - This field passes DBMS-specific connection parameters. [[MTServerConfigConnectOptions|Review Complete Settings and Usage for Connect Options]]
#* **Connect now to verify that all settings are correct** - Will attempt to connect to the database, after you input Username and Pasword and click Continue.
#* **Username** - A valid database uid.
#* **Password** -  A valid database password.
# Click Continue.
# The options tab contains settings that are not required for a basic connection:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Generic_Options.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Read Only connection** - Specifies whether the connection is "Read-only." Make sure the checkbox is unchecked to request a "Read/Write" connection.
#* **Defer fetching of long data** - Defers fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data unless explicitly requested in a query. This provides significant performance increases when fields in query do not include LONG data fields.
#* **Disable interactive login** - Suppresses the ODBC "Username" and "Password" login dialog boxes when interacting with your ODBC DSN from within an ODBC compliant application.
#* **Multiple Active Statements Emulation** - Enables use of Multiple Active statements in an ODBC application even if the underlying database does not allow this, as it is emulated in the driver.
#* **Row Buffer Size** - This attribute specifies the number of records to be transported over the network in a single network hop. Values can range from 1 to 99.
# Click Continue.
# Click on the 'Test Data Source' button to make a connection to the database to verify Client-to-Broker connectivity:
