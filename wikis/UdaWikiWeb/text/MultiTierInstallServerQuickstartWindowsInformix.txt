==<nop>OpenLink Multi-tier Server Side Components (Windows) for <nop>Informix==

===Aims and Intentions ===

This guide is intended to enable competent system administrators to install and configure <nop>OpenLink Multi-tier client side components on Windows operating systems in a few steps as possible.

This guide does not explain any of the non-pertinent features encountered along the way. Such explanations may be found in the full documentation.

===Prerequisites===

* You **MUST** be proficient in using Command Prompt (CMD/DOS) window (for preferred testing purposes).
* There **MUST** be an existing installation of either Informix (full), Informix CSDK, or Informix Connect present on the machine, and you **MUST** know where this installation resides.
* You **MUST** have a preconfigured <nop>{{{INFORMIX_SERVER}}}.  [[ConfigureInformixClientWindows|This should be configured]] using Informix "{{{setnet32}}}" and connectivity proven using Informix "{{{iLogin Demo}}}".

===Installation===

# Copy all relevant installation components to a suitable starting directory such as your Desktop. At a minimum, these will include the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker, an <nop>OpenLink Database Agent for <nop>Informix, and an <nop>OpenLink license file ({{{oplrqb.lic}}}).
# Install the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker which will prompt for the license file.
# Install the <nop>OpenLink Database Agent for <nop>Informix.
# All installers should finish without error.

===Licensing===

<nop>OpenLink Multi-tier licensing is handled on the server side so you should have provided the location of the license file ({{{oplrqb.lic}}}) during the installation of the Request Broker component.

If you chose to skip that part, you should now copy the license file to {{{c:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin}}} (or the {{{\bin\}}} subdirectory of your custom installation location).

===Configuration===

<nop>Informix requires a small amount of additional environmental configuration in the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker session rule book (c:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin\oplrqb.ini)--

# Open the file {{{c:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin\oplrqb.ini}}} with a suitable text editor, such as Wordpad.
# Locate and edit the {{{[Environment xxxxx]}}} section (where //{{{xxxxx}}}// matches your target database), and ensure that any relevant environment variables pertaining your system and target database are correct. //**NOTE:** You may need to consult with your database administrator to verify these.//  The following example depicts an environment section for Informix --
{{{
[Environment INFORMIX2000]
INFORMIXSERVER        = your_informix_server
INFORMIXDIR           = C:\Program Files\IBM\Informix\Client-SDK
DELIMIDENT            = Y      ; Allow quoted identifiers
OPL_INF_MULTISESS     = Y      ; Allow multiple sessions
OPL_SPACEPADCHAR      = Y      ; Pad CHAR fields with spaces
CURSOR_SENSITIVITY    = LOW    ; Set to HIGH after loading oplrvc.sql
;FET_BUF_SIZE          = 65535  ; Size of the fetch buffer
;FORCE_ONLINE_DATABASE = 1      ; Force mode to (0) SE or (1) ONLINE
;CLIENT_LOCALE         = EN_US.UTF8  ; Uncomment and adjust when Client and Server locale settings differ
Path                  = C:\Program Files\IBM\Informix\Client-SDK\bin  ; Find shared libraries
}}}

===Start the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker=== 

==== Starting in Debug Mode ====
It is often best to initially start the Request Broker in debug mode ({{{oplrqb +debug}}}) in order to diagnose problems.

To do this, you must first stop the "<nop>OpenLink Request Broker" service.

Then, open a "Command Prompt" (Start >> Run... >> CMD) window and --
{{{
C:\> cd c:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin
C:\> oplrqb +debug

}}}
The <nop>OpenLink Request Broker will continue to run, taking over the session, until &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; is entered which stops the Broker%BR%

==== Starting Normally ====

To start the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker normally, simply restart the "**<nop>OpenLink Request Broker**" service through the **Services** control panel.

===Testing===

You are now ready to test the connection.  This requires that you read the relevant [[MultiTierQuickStart|quick start guide for client component]] on the chosen operating system and have the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker running in Debug Mode as detailed above.

===Additional Information===

Changes made to {{{c:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin\oplrqb.ini}}} will not take effect until the Request Broker is reinitialized or (in some cases) stopped and restarted.  

Open a "Command Prompt" window and -
{{{
C:\> cd c:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin
C:\> oplshut +reinit
