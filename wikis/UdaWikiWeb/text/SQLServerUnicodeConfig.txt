==Database Configuration for Unicode==

===Microsoft SQL Server 2000===

There are no Unicode-specific settings for Microsoft SQL Server. When creating a Database, the collation type for the database can be specified but there is no UTF8 or Unicode specific setting, and a wide (Unicode) language type like Chinese or similar has to be selected, after which wide (Unicode) data can be inserted into the Microsoft SQL Server wide character types NCHAR & NVARCHAR.
