= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Multi-Tier "Enterprise" Edition Request Broker and Database Agent(s) for Ingres, for Unix-like OS =

%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements ==

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target Ingres DBMS instance and database:

* [[HowCanIFindMyIngresNodeName|The Ingres node name]] 
* [[HowCanIFindMyIngresListenAddress|The Ingres listen address]] 
* The Ingres database name

== Software Requirements ==

*  You will need an installation of the Ingres native client on a supported operating system, if you cannot install the Multi-Tier server components on the same machine as Ingres. At the time of writing, this product is called Ingres-Net. Product names may vary over time.
* You must know whether the local Ingres components are 32-bit or 64-bit. The Multi-Tier server components must match the bit format of the local Ingres components, not the OS.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* The Request Broker and database-specific Agents must be installed on the same machine as Ingres or an Ingres native client. If you install on the same machine as the Ingres native client, you must have a [[ConfigureIngresVnodeUnix|vnode]] configured.
* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are already in use on the Broker host. These ports are the defaults used by our Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. If other services are using these, you will need to assign different (unused) ports to the new services during installation.
* For best results, the Multi-Tier server components should be installed while logged in as the local Ingres or Ingres native client owner.
* All Ingres-related environment variables should be set prior to installation. This is typically accomplished simply by logging in as the local Ingres or Ingres native client owner, but if logged in as a different user, you can often achieve the same by using that user's <code>.profile</code> or similar, with a command like one of these (depending on your active shell) --
{{{
source ./.profile
. ./.profile
}}}
