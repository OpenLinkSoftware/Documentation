The Single-Tier ODBC Drivers for Progress conform to the common architectural perceptions of an ODBC driver -- a single component installed on a desktop, workstation, or application server machine that depends on additional database specific networking middleware (from the relevant database vendor) for local or remote database connectivity. 

The [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier Drivers for Progress 4GL(SQL-89) are a Type A class of driver developed using the Progress ESQL/C call level interface and assumes the pre-installation of the Progress Network Client software for the target Progress Server release.

The [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier Drivers for Progress SQL-92 are a Type A class of driver developed using the Progress SQL-92 call level interface and assumes the pre-installation of the Progress Network Client software for the target Progress Server release.
