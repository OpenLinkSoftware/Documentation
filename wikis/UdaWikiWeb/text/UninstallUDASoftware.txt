= Uninstalling Our Components =

Removing installations of our components takes different steps for different platforms.

%TOC%

== Windows ==

You may use the uninstall utility to remove existing Windows software. You may also use the **Add/Remove Programs** utility, which appears in the **Control Panel**. 

== Mac OS X ==

The following sequence will cleanly remove all iODBC and Data Access components added by our installers.

# Double-click the **{{{Uninstall.command}}}** script ({{{/Applications/OpenLink/Universal Data Access Drivers (* Tier Edition)}}}). If the script is not present,  skip ahead to #3.%BR%%BR%
# Answer the questions posed by the script. Please note that you must answer with the mixed-case, full-word answers. Anything other than `**{{{Yes}}}**`, `**{{{All}}}**`, or `**{{{Quit}}}**`, will be interpreted as `**{{{No}}}**`, including `**{{{y}}}**`, `**{{{Y}}}**`, and `**{{{yes}}}**`.%BR%%BR%

== Unix-like OS -- AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, etc. ==

We do not provide an uninstall utility for Unix-like platforms. **{{{rm}}}** and **{{{rmdir}}}** should be used to remove existing deployments.
