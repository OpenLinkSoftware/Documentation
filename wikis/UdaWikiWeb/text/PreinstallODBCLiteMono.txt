==<nop>OpenLink .NET Data Provider for ODBC Pre-Installation Requirements==

=== Pre-Installation Requirements for Mono Clients===

==== DBMS Requirements====

* Your target database must be ODBC and SQL compliant. 
* You must possess enough knowledge to establish an ODBC connection to this database using third-party or native ODBC drivers. 

==== Software Requirements====

* You need a functional Mono CLR runtime.

* You need to ensure that you have the iODBC or other ODBC Driver Manager installed on non-Windows platforms.

* You must possess third-party or native drivers that connect to your target database. A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as <nop>OpenLink's .NET Data Provider for ODBC.

==== Configuration Requirements====

* You will need to ensure that your environment is configured to promote connectivity using your third-party or native ODBC driver. <nop>OpenLink Product Support can provide minimal assistance in this area. Ideally, you will use your drivers to create a System Data Source Name for greater compatibility with <nop>OpenLink needs.

* You must know the exact name of one or more third party or native Data Source Names that connect to your target data source.
