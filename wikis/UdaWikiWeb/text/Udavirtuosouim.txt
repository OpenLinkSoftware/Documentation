Virtuoso covers the following areas: 

**Enterprise Data & Information Integration* via a Virtual Database engine that provides a single XML, ODBC, JDBC, .NET, or OLE DB connection to heterogeneous data sources that includes all major database engines, HTML/XHTML, XML, Free Text, and Multimedia data.  
**Semantic Content Production & Syndication* through leveraging of built-in support for XSL-T, XML Schema, SQLX, XQuery, and XPath, which enables the transformation of heterogeneous data into a myriad of semantic data forms such as RSS, FOAF, RDF, and beyond.  
* **Service Composition ** by exposure of existing time-tested application logic for invocation using Web Services protocols without any code re-writes. Code format support includes SQL Stored Procedures, .NET assemblies, Java Classes, C/C++ modules, etc.  
* **Service Invocation Endpoints ** via HTTP/WebDAV based virtual directory and multi-homing functionality that provides endpoints for SOAP-, WS-Security-, WSDL-, and UDDI-compliant interactions with composite services.  
* **Process Orchestration ** by expression of application or solution behavior as a collective interaction across composite services, processes, and associated events.
