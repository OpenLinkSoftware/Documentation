=Error Message: {{{Could not find symbol '<nop>SQLAllocConnect' in dynamic library}}}=

Errors like "{{{Could not find symbol '<nop>SQLAllocConnect' in dynamic library}}}" have been reported to occur when the glibc version present when we built our components does not match the glibc version of the Linux box on which the components are being installed. Generally, components built with an older glibc can be used on a machine with a newer glibc, but best results will come with the closest possible match.  

To resolve this error, check your libc version, with a command like these:
{{{
rpm -qa &#124; grep glibc

apt-cache show libc6 &#124; grep glibc-2

/lib/libc.so.6
}}}

Then [[http://download.openlinksw.com/solwiz/| download]] or request components that more closely match your environment.
