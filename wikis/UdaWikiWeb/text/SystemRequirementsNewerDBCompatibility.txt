===What if my database version is newer than the officially supported version? ===

Components from <nop>OpenLink Software are generally upward compatible, and should function with newer databases. 

//**Of special note:** Progress databases and <nop>OpenLink components for Progress are compatible, as long as both products share the same major number. For instance, the Database Agent for Progress 8.2A will also connect to Progress 8.1A and 8.3E instances. However, components built for use with Progress 7 will not work with Progress 8.//
