==Configuring Oracle for XA support ==

XA support has been tested against Oracle version 9i and 10g

===Granting SELECT Privilege on V$XATRANS$ & DBA_PENDING_TRANSACTIONS Views===

You must grant SELECT privilege to the V$XATRANS$ view for all Oracle accounts that XA applications will use. Otherwise, xa_recover will fail, in the event that TM needs to perform a recovery. If the view does not already exist in your Oracle installation, it can be manually loaded using the following SQL script which should be included in your Oracle installation:

{{{
$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/xaview.sql
}}}

The example below shows an extract from an Oracle XA Library trace file. Oracle returns error **ORA-00942 : table or view does not exist**, because user scott does not have the necessary SELECT privilege on the V$XATRANS$ view.

{{{

}}}

The syntax for adding the grant privilege to the 'scott' user is:

{{{
grant select on V$XATRANS$ to scott;
}}}

In addition, the "ORA-00942: table or view does not exist" error also occurs if select privileges are not granted on the {{{DBA_PENDING_TRANSACTIONS}}} view, requiring the following command to be executed as a DBA user:

{{{ 
GRANT SELECT ON DBA_PENDING_TRANSACTIONS TO PUBLIC
    }}}      

%RED%Note: The V$XATRANS$ did not exist nor did the DBA_PENDING_TRANSACTIONS view have appropriate select privileges in Unix Oracle installations, although they are included in Windows installations by default.%ENDCOLOR%
