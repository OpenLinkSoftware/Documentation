== How to Change these Advanced Settings

=== ...on Mac OS X ===

Global configuration information is contained in {{{/Users/*/Library/Preferences/com.openlinksw.uda.plist}}}.

For best results, use the **System Preferences** >> **<nop>OpenLink Settings** preference pane to change these settings.

If necessary, any plist editor (or even a plain-text editor) can be used to edit this settings file.

=== ...on Windows ===

Global configuration information is contained in the {{{OPENLINK.INI}}} sub-section of the registry. Windows platforms use the registry to store all configuration information. 

To edit or view to registry, run the {{{regedit}}} program. To view the <nop>OpenLink settings, drill down to the following section:

 **{{{HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\OPENLINK.INI}}}**

=== ...on Unix-like OS ===

{{{[Communications]}}} settings are stored in the active {{{$ODBCINI}}} file.  Most other settings may be found in {{{$OPENLINKINI}}}.
