==What does Custom Catalog Views do?==

"Custom Catalog Views" dictates whether custom OpenLink views are used to return metadata for certain ODBC catalog functions; SQLForeignKeys, SQLPrimaryKeys, SQLProcedureColumns, SQLProcedures, and SQLSpecialColumns. These custom views provide more metadata than is normally provided by the standard Oracle data dictionary views.

To create and use the views, you must first run the odbccat[8|9].sql script. Use the following steps to perform that action:

#. Login to the machine that contains the Oracle DBMS.
#. su to the oracle user.
#. Execute the .profile associated with the oracle user.
#. cd into the bin sub-directory of the Oracle installation.
#. Run the Oracle server manager command, i.e., svrmgr or sqldba.
#. Connect as internal.
#. Execute the odbccat.sql script like any other Oracle script file.
#. Exit the Oracle server manager.

The above actions will result in the creation of the following views:

OPENLINK$SQL_ FOREIGN_ KEYS
OPENLINK$SQL_ PRIMARY_ KEYS
OPENLINK$SQL_ SPEC_ COLUMNS
OPENLINK$SQL_ PROC_ COLUMNS
OPENLINK$SQL_ PROCEDURES
OPENLINK$SQL_ PROCS_ NOCOUNT
