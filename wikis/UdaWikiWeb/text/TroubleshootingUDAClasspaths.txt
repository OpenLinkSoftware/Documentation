===Classpaths===

The {{{CLASSPATH}}} variable should include the full path to an <nop>OpenLink {{{opljdbc.jar}}} or {{{megathin.jar}}} file. You need to consider the following factors when examining {{{CLASSPATH}}} environment variables:

# Was {{{CLASSPATH}}} set at the time of reported failure? Review the output of {{{set}}}, the Windows {{{autoexec.bat}}} file, or Windows System utility screenshots for corroboration.
# Does {{{CLASSPATH}}} point to a valid .jar file? Review the output of {{{ls}}} or {{{dir}}} in the directory structure for the purpose of corroboration.
# Do file or directory permissions issues restrict access to the .jar file?
# Does the .jar file JDK version correspond with the client JRE version?
# Does {{{CLASSPATH}}} need to be set within application code?
