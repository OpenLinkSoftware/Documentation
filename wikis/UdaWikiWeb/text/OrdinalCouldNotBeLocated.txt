=The ordinal #### could not be located in the dynamic link library LIBEAY32.dll (among others)=

This error message usually indicates that there are multiple copies of the named DLL.  The OS is usually finding and loading and older version than the driver or other failing component requires.

Any executable which cannot use the newer DLL should have its own older DLL in its own C:\Program Files\... subdirectory.  Most tools that have been linked with older DLL versions work fine with the newer.  Most tools that have been linked with newer DLL versions cannot use the older.

To resolve the issue, use the SEARCH tool to find all copies of the named DLL, and check their date and/or version information.  Most often, the trouble-making file will be in C:\System32\.

Rename any older versions of the file that are found in system directories, to something along the lines of <code>libeay32.dll.OLD</code>, keeping only the newest with its original name.  Retest your tools...
