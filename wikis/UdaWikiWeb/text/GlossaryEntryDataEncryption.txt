Data Encryption is a Communications parameter, which occurs in various places. You may see it in the <nop>OpenLink Client Configuration Utility, the Session Rules Book, the Administrative Assistant, or the udbc.ini file. When it is checked off or set to Yes, outgoing data will be encrypted. Be advised -- if you want bi-directional encryption, you must set this parameter in both your client and server   
configuration files. 

Example: {{{DataEncryption = Yes}}} 

Variants: <nop>DataEncryption
