= Output of {{{oplshut}}} =

The command {{{oplshut -s}}} produces output like this:
{{{
[openlink@openlinux bin]$ oplshut -s
SVPID  SVTYPE  MACHINE            OPSYS  APPLIC    DATABASE  USERNAME  CONNECT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1480  mys3    dyn2.example.com   msdos  cppdmo32  test      mysql     Mar 30 12:01
}}}

Here is a brief overview of the output displayed by {{{oplshut -s}}}:

* **SVPID** - Associates a Process Identification Number with a database agent. You can run <code>oplshut +kill &lt;svpid&gt;</code> to terminate database agents that will not disconnect. For example:
{{{
oplshut +kill 1480
}}}
//**Note:** {{{oplshut +kill}}}} will terminate **all** connections associated with an agent process. This is important since multi-threaded agents may handle multiple connections simultaneously.//

* **SVTYPE** - Passes a label which identifies the Domain Alias, which was used to establish the connection. The Domain Aliases appear in the Session Rules Book (<code>oplrqb.ini</code>). For example:
{{{
[Domain Aliases]
DB2          = db2
Informix 5     = inf5
Informix 6     = inf6
Informix 7.1   = inf71
Informix 7.2   = inf72
Informix 7.3   = inf73
Informix 2000  = inf2000
Ingres 6       = ing6
MySQL 3.x      = mys3
}}}
These aliases facilitate the resolution and configuration of connections. They associate each connection request with a specific Mapping Rule, Database Agent configuration section, and Environment section. For example:
{{{
[Environment MYSQL]
CURSOR_SENSITIVITY = LOW

[Mapping Rules]
mys3:**:**:**:**:**:**  = accept generic_mys3

[generic_mys3]
Description = Default settings for MySQL 3.x agent
Program       = mys3_mv
Environment = MYSQL
ReUse       = always
}}}

* **MACHINE** - Identifies the machine from which the connection request originated.

* **OPSYS** - Identifies the operating system of the machine, from which the connection originated.

* **APPLIC** - Identifies the application that has initiated the connection.

* **DATABASE** - Identifies the target database to which the driver connects.

* **USERNAME** - Identifies the username used to authenticate against the database or operating system.

* **CONNECT** - The connection's inception date and time. This field is useful for detection of lingering connections.  

 **Note:** If stability problems arise, you should compare the output of the following two commands (substituting your Agent configuration stanza for "generic_agent"):

<code><pre>oplshut -s

ps -ef <nop>| grep generic_agent</pre></code>

Certain older Request Brokers can suffer from corruption of the internal tables that they use to monitor connections. Consequently, Brokers lose track of agents. While <code>oplshut -s</code> shows no or few agent connections, <code>ps -ef | grep generic_agent</code> will show many agents. Here is normal <code>oplshut</code> and <code>ps</code> output:
<code><pre>bash$ oplshut -s
SVPID  SVTYPE  MACHINE             OPSYS  APPLIC    DATABASE  USERNAME  CONNECT
<nop>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30003  mys3    dyn243.example.com  msdos  cppdmo32  Northwin  sa        Apr 09 10:46

bash$ ps -ef <nop>| grep generic_mys3
openlink 30003   29324  0 10:46:33  0:00 generic_mys3 +internal </pre></code>

Abnormal output would have {{{ps}}} showing more agent processes than {{{oplshut}}}.
