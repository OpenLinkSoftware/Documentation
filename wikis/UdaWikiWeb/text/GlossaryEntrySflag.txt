===-S===

-S is a service-related option, which may be passed to the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker or Virtuoso service. -S takes its own parameters, as well. For instance, you may pass <i>-S start</i>. This will start Virtuoso or the Broker. Likewise, you may pass <i>-S stop</i>. This will terminate Virtuoso or the Broker. 
<P>
For a complete list of -S functions, use your command line to descend into your product's /bin subdirectory. Then, type in the command, which you would normally use to start your service. However, add -? to the end of that command. 
<P>
Example: ./oplrqb -? 
<P>
This will return usage information for the -S option. To employ -S, use the following syntax: 
<P>
<i>startup_command  -S  -S_parameter</i>
<P>
Example: ./oplrqb -S create 
<P>
