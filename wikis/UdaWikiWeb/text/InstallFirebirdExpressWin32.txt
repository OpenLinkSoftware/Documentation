==Configuration==

# Launch the **ODBC Administrator** [[Win32vs64OdbcAdmin | appropriate to the bitness (32-bit or 64-bit) of your client application and driver]].
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/frbconf01.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# Click on the Drivers tab to confirm that the driver has been successfully installed:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/frbconf02.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# From either the User or System DSN tab, click on the Add button and select the Express Edition Driver from the list. Select the Unicode version of the driver **if and only if** you are working with multi-byte character sets, as unnecessary translations can significantly affect ODBC performance:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/frbconf03.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# On the Data Source tab, provide a suitable DSN name and optional description for the Data Source to be created:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/frbconf04.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
# The Connection tab requests the minimum parameters required to make a connection to the target database:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/frbconf05.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Host**: This is the fully qualified host name or IP address of the machine hosting the DBMS you wish to access, e.g., dbms-server.example.com or 192.168.155.123. Any host name which can be resolved by your local DNS is acceptable.
#* **Port**: This is the port on which Firebird listens.
#* **<nop>DatabasePath**: This is the path and filename of the database file (.fdb) to which you want to connect.
#* **Connect now to verify that all settings are correct**: Will attempt to connect to the database, once you click Continue.
#* **Login ID**: This is a valid user for the Firebird database.
#* **Password**: This is a valid password for the Firebird database.
# The advanced button displays additional, optional parameters that can be configured:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/frbconf06.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
|**Name**|**Description** |
|**<nop>BlobBufferLength** | Sets BLOB buffer length. This value influences performance when working with BLOB fields. | 
| **<nop>BlobBufferSize** | Size of the BLOB buffer in bytes. | 
| **<nop>BuffersNumber** | Number of cache buffers that should be allocated for this connection. It should be specified for <nop>ClassicServer instances. <nop>SuperServer has a server-wide configuration parameter. | 
| **<nop>DefaultIsolation** | Sets the default transaction isolation level as string. The following strings are allowed: 'TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED', 'TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ', 'TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE' | 
| **Encoding** | Sets encoding for connections produced by this data source. | 
| **<nop>LoginTimeout** | Sets login timeout for this datasource in seconds. | 
| **<nop>RoleName** | SQL role to use. | 
| **<nop>SocketBufferSize** | Socket buffer size in bytes. | 
| **<nop>SqlDialect** | SQL dialect of the client. | 
| **<nop>TimestampUsesLocalTimezone** | Set to 'true' if the <nop>JayBird 1.0 handling of the calendar in corresponding setters. This is also compatible with the <nop>MySQL calendar treatment. | 
| **<nop>UseStandardUdf** | Set to 'true,' if driver should assume that standard UDF are installed. | 
| **<nop>UseStreamBlobs** | Set to 'true,' if stream blobs should be created. Otherwise, set to 'false.' | 
| **<nop>UseTranslation** | Path to the character translation table. | 
| **<nop>CharSet** | Character set for the connection. Similar to encoding property, but accepts Java names instead of Firebird ones. |
# Click continue to proceed to the Options dialog. This dialog contains optional parameters that are not required for basic ODBC connectivity:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/frbconf07.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Drop Catalog from Meta calls** - Enable this option to have the catalog name not appear for tables, views, and procedures when requesting database meta-data.
#* **Drop Schema from Meta calls** - Enable this option to have the schema-name not appear for tables, views, and procedures when requesting database meta-data.
#* **Return and empty <nop>ResultSet for SQLStatistics** - Check this box to have SQLStatistics() return an empty resultset. Use this if the underlying database does not support retrieval of statistics about a table (e.g. what indexes it has).
#* **Disable support of quoted identifier** - If set, the call <nop>SQLGetInfo for 'SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR' will return a space (" "). It can be used if the DBMS doesn't support quoted SQL like select * from "account."
#* **Disable support of search string escape** - If set, the call <nop>SQLGetInfo for 'SQL_LIKE_ESCAPE_CLAUSE' will return a space (" "). It can be used if the DBMS doesn't support SQL escape patterns.
#* **Patch NULL size of SQL_CHAR** - If set, this option overrides the size of SQL_CHAR column type returned by the database with the value set in the text box (in bytes). With a default value of 0, the driver uses the size returned by the database.
# Click continue to proceed to the Preferences dialog. This dialog contains optional parameters that are not required for basic ODBC connectivity:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/frbconf08.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Read Only connection** - Specifies whether the connection is "Read-only." Make sure the checkbox is unchecked to request a "Read/Write" connection.
#* **Defer fetching of long data** - Defers fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data unless explicitly requested in a query. This provides significant performance increases when fields in query do not include LONG data fields.
#* **Disable interactive login** - Suppresses the ODBC "Username" and "Password" login dialog boxes when interacting with your ODBC DSN from within an ODBC compliant application.
#* **Row Buffer Size** - This attribute specifies the number of records to be transported over the network in a single network hop. Values can range from 1 to 99.
#* **Max Rows Override** - Allows you to define a limit on the maximum number of rows to be returned from a query. The default value of 0 means no limit.
#* **Initial SQL** - Lets you specify a file containing SQL statements that will be run automatically against the database upon connection.
#* **Dynamic cursor sensitivity** - Enables or disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library calculates checksums for each row in the current rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already stored in the row version cache for the same rows when fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the row has been updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user's point of view, the only visible difference between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same. Deleted rows don't appear in the rowset. Updates to the row since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in the rowset, if their keys fall within the span of the rowset. If your application does not need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the 'High Cursor Sensitivity' checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the table oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the appropriate script for the target database.
#* **Enable logging to the log file** - Pass a full path to an arbitrary log file that will be used to log ODBC API and SQL related errors.
# Click Next to continue to the Compatibility dialog . The Compatibility dialog enables you to set additional parameters to enhance compatibility with applications:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/frbconf09.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
#* **Disable Autocommit** - Change the default commit behaviour of the <nop>OpenLink Lite Driver. The default mode is <nop>AutoCommit mode (box unchecked).
#* **Disable Rowset Size Limit** - Disable the limitation enforced by the cursor library. The limitation is enforced by default to prevent the Driver claiming all available memory in the event that a resultset is generated from an erroneous query is very large. The limit is normally never reached.
#* **Multiple Active Statements Emulation** - Enables use of Multiple Active statements in an ODBC application even if the underlying database does not allow this, as it is emulated in the driver.
#* **SQL_DBMS Name** - Manually overrides the <nop>SQLGetInfo(SQL_DBMS_NAME) response returned by the driver. This is required for products like Microsoft <nop>InfoPath for which the return the value should be "SQL Server."
# Click on the **Test Data Source** button to verify that a successful connection can be made to the database.
