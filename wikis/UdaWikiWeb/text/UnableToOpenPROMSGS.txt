== Multi-Tier Drivers ==

# Use a text editor to open the active Rulebook (default, {{{<OPENLINK_INSTALL>/bin/oplrqb.ini}}}).
# Locate the {{{[Environment PROGRESSXXX]}}} section which corresponds to your database agent. For example:
{{{
[Environment PROGRESS82A]
DLC = C:/Pro82aDLC
Path = C:/Pro82aDLC/BIN;D:/WINNT/System32
;PROMSGS = C:/DLC
}}}
# Insure that {{{PROMSGS}}} is uncommented (no leading semicolon, ";") and set to the full path to your local {{{promsgs}}} file. For example:
{{{
[Environment PROGRESS82A] 
DLC = C:/Pro82aDLC 
Path = C:/Pro82aDLC/BIN;D:/WINNT/System32 
PROMSGS = C:/Pro82aDLC/bin/promsgs
}}}
# Save your changes and exit the file.
# Restart your Broker and test.


== Single-Tier Drivers ==
# Open the <b>System</b> control panel.
# Set the variable on the <b>Environment</b> or <b>Advanced</b> tab. If you have a choice between System and User variables, set this under System.  For example:
{{{
PROMSGS    C:/DLC/bin/promsgs
}}}
# If you do not have the System utility, you will need to set {{{PROMSGS}}} in your {{{autoexec.bat}}}. You will also need to reboot. Here is a sample {{{autoexec.bat}}} entry:
{{{
set PROMSGS=C:/DLC/bin/promsgs
}}}
# Test.


== Evidence ==

* Request Broker Log ({{{oplrqb.log}}})
* Request Broker Rulebook  ({{{oplrqb.ini}}})
* Environment variable settings (output of {{{env}}} and/or {{{set}}})
