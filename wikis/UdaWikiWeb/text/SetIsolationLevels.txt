==Set Isolation Levels==

You may use <nop>OpenLink's +initsql parameter to change your database isolation level. The following instructions will assist you with this task: 

1. Insure that your database supports the operation which you want to implement.  Verify the syntax which that database will accept. 

2. Create a file in the /bin sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink server components installation. This file should contain only the isolation level syntax.  For example: 

{{{
-Dsrv TXN_ISOLATION, SERIALIZABLE 
}}}

3. Open the oplrqb.ini file which resides within the same /bin sub-directory. 

4. Locate the [generic_XXXXX] section which corresponds to the database agent which you use.  For example:

{{{
[generic_inf7]
Program     = inf7_mv.exe
Environment = INFORMIX7
OpsysLogin  = Yes
ReUse       = always
;Directory 	= c:\temp
;ConnectOptions =
;ReadOnly	=
;CommandLine =
}}}

5. Locate the "<nop>CommandLine" parameter, and pass the file which you have created.  For example: 

{{{
CommandLine = +initsql yourisolationfile 
}}}

6. Remove any semicolon (;) which may appear in front of <nop>CommandLine.

7. Save your changes and exit the oplrqb.ini file.

8. Restart the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker by typing the following commands from the same /bin sub-directory: 

{{{
./oplshut         
./oplrqb +loglevel 7 +logfile oplrqb.log 
}}}

9. Test.
