==II_SYSTEM==

The II_SYSTEM environment variable passes the absolute path to your Ingres root directory.

Note: This is not the "ingres" directory. The "ingres" directory is a sub-directory of the Ingres installation. Thus, II_SYSTEM passes the absolute path to the directory that contains the "ingres" subdirectory. For instance:

{{{
-bash-2.05b$ echo $II_SYSTEM
/dbs3/ingresII
-bash-2.05b$ cd $II_SYSTEM
-bash-2.05b$ ls
ingres		 readme.html
