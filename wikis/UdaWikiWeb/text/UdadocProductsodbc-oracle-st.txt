The Single-Tier ODBC Drivers for Oracle conform to the common architectural perceptions of an ODBC driver -- a single component installed on a desktop, workstation, or application server machine that depends on additional database specific networking middleware (from the relevant database vendor) for local or remote database connectivity. 

The [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier Drivers for Oracle are a Type A class driver developed using the Oracle OCI call level interface and assumes the pre installation of Oracle SQL*Net, Net8, Net9, or Net10 depending on your Oracle Server release. 

These drivers are currently available for Oracle versions 7.x, 8.x, 9.x, 10.x and beyond.
