= Changing or Resetting Access Restrictions for the Multi-Tier Request Broker's Admin Assistant =

== Changing User Access ==

# Load the Admin Assistant in a browser.  The default URL is [[http://broker-host-or-ip:8000/| http://broker-hostname-or-ip-address:8000/ ]].
# Drill down to **Server Components Administration** -> **Admin Assistant Settings** -> **Configure the List of Users Allowed to use the Admin Assistant**.  When prompted to log in, use the defaults or whatever you've set previously.
# Click **Edit**, **Remove**, or **Add** as appropriate, until the list reflects your intention.
# Optionally,  drill down to **Server Components Administration** -> **Admin Assistant Settings** -> **Configure the Admin Assistant's Remote Access Filters**.  Here you can restrict the IP addresses which may use Web browsers to access the Admin Assistant.
# When you've finished, stop and restart the Request Broker, which will automatically restart the Admin Assistant.
# Test your new settings.

== Resetting to Defaults ==

The default username and password of the Multi-Tier Admin Assistant are both **{{{admin}}}**. If you cannot log in with these values, you may have changed them during installation. You can reset these through the following steps:

# Access the machine which hosts the Multi-Tier server components.
# Open a CMD/DOS or Unix terminal session.
# Navigate to the {{{/bin/w3config}}} sub-directory of the server-side installation.
# Run {{{setup}}} or {{{setup.exe}}}.  This program will reset both username and password to the defualt -- i.e., "**{{{admin}}}**".
