=Error Message: {{{Internal rpc call failed (Interrupted system call): RPC: Timed out}}}=

There are several variants of the "Internal RPC call failed" error. 

One variant occurs when you do not include your database's {{{/lib}}} sub-directory in the shared library environment variable. This "Internal" error generally contains the text, "Interrupted system call." If you receive "Interrupted system call" errors, take the following action:

# Use a text editor to open your {{{oplrqb.ini}}} file. You will find this file in the {{{/bin}}} sub-directory of the Broker installation.
# Locate the {{{[Environment]}}} section, which corresponds to the active database agent. For example:
{{{
[Environment ORACLE80]
ORACLE_HOME = /dbs/oracle80
ORACLE_SID = ORCL
;ORACLE_SERVER = T
;TWO_TASK = P:
;ODBC_CATALOGS = Y;
;MULTIPLEX_LDA = 5;
;OPL_USR_TBLS_FIRST = Y;
SHOW_REMARKS = N;
CURSOR_SENSITIVITY = LOW;
;OCI_PREFETCH_ROWS = 100;
;OCI_PREFETCH_MEMORY = 65535;
;LD_LIBRARY_PATH = /dbs/oracle80/lib;$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
;SHLIB_PATH = /dbs/oracle80/lib;$SHLIB_PATH
;LIBPATH = /dbs/oracle80/lib;$LIBPATH
}}}
# Add the full path to your database's {{{/lib}}} sub-directory to the {{{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}} (General), {{{LIBPATH}}} (AIX), and/or {{{SHLIB_PATH}}} (HP/UX). For example:
{{{
SHLIB_PATH=/usr/openlink/lib:/oracle/product/8.1.7/lib;$SHLIB_PATH
}}}
# Save your changes and exit the file.
# Restart or reinitialize your Broker.
# Test.

If your error does not contain "Interrupted System Call," contact <nop>OpenLink Product Support
