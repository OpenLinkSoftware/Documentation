= Error Message: {{{Number of licensed connections exceeded}}} =

This error means just what it says -- you (or your data access client application) are trying to open more concurrent database sessions than your active license file permits.

If you know how many additional sessions you require, you can immediately [[http://www.openlinksw.com/contact| pursue an upgrade with Sales]].

If you don't know how many additional sessions are required, or feel that this message is itself an error, please [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp| log a Support Case]], and we'll work with you to find the best resolution.
