== Configuration ==

Each OLE DB client application provides its own interface for configuring these connections.  We cannot provide documentation for all such configurations.

If you're working with Microsoft SQL Server, [[UDASystemIntegrationConfigDocs|this page]] should be of use.

If another OLE DB client application asks for a connect string, [[OLEDBConnectionStrings|this page]] should help you get started.

Additional configuration may be required. Consult our other documentation or [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp|log a free support case]] for additional assistance.
