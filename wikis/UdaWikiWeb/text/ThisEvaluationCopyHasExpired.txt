===This evaluation copy has expired===

"This evaluation copy has expired" errors will occur, if you do not obtain a license for your <nop>OpenLink Single-Tier drivers. <nop>OpenLink's Single-Tier drivers must be licensed after the sixty-day evaluation period has expired.

If you have obtained a Single-Tier license -- and you continue to experience registration errors -- you may have received an inappropriate license key. Please forward a copy of your license and your driver version to <nop>OpenLink Product Support. Be advised -- certain Progress Large Client drivers register with Progress Small Client keys. Ask Product Support for guidance.

If you are certain that you have obtained the correct license, you may have a corrupt registry. You will need to uninstall your <nop>OpenLink Single-Tier driver, remove references to the driver from your registry, and reinstall. Subsequent attempts to register the Single-Tier driver should succeed.
