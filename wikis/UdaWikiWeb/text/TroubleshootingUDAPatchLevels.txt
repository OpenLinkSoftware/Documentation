===Operating System Patch Levels===

Use the following guidelines:

# Insure that you have applied all, current operating system patches.
# Determine whether or not the DBMS requires a specific patch level.
# Ascertain whether specific patches are associated with issues that you have encountered. Depending upon the circumstances, either the presence or absence of patches can cause problems.
# Compare your patch level to the <nop>OpenLink build server patch level. Discrepancies between patch levels may contribute to compatibility and stability problems. Depending on the circumstances, either you or <nop>OpenLink may need to update a machine to a higher patch level.
