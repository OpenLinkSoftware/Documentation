==<nop>OpenLink Multi-tier Server Side Components (Windows) for Sybase==

===Aims and Intentions ===

This guide is intended to enable competent system administrators to install and configure <nop>OpenLink Multi-tier client side components on Windows operating systems in a few steps as possible.

This guide does not explain any of the non-pertinent features encountered along the way. Such explanations may be found in the full documentation.

===Prerequisites===

* You **MUST** be proficient in using Command Prompt window (for preferred testing purposes).

===Installation===

# Copy all relevant installation components to a suitable starting directory such as your Desktop.%BR%%BR% As a bare minimum, these will include; the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker, an <nop>OpenLink Database Agent for your respective target database and finally an <nop>OpenLink license file (oplrqb.lic).%BR%
# Install the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker which will prompt for the license file%BR%
# Install the <nop>OpenLink Database Agent for SQL Server/Sybase%BR%
# All installers should finish without error.%BR%

===Licensing===

<nop>OpenLink Multi-tier licensing is handled on the server side so you should have provided the location of the license file (oplrqb.lic) during the installation of the Request Broker component.

If you chose to skip that part then you should now copy the license file to c:\Program Files\OpenLinkSoftware\UDA\bin

===Configuration===

Sybase needs no additional configuration.

===Start the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker=== 

# **Starting in foreground debug mode**%BR%
It is often best to initially start the Request Broker in (f)oreground (d)ebug in order to diagnose problems--%BR%
In order to do this you must stop the "<nop>OpenLink Request Broker" service.%BR%
Now, open a "Command Prompt" window and --
{{{
 #cd c:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin
 #oplrqb -fd

The <nop>OpenLink Request Broker will continue to run, taking over the session, until &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; is entered which stops the Broker%BR%
# **Starting Normally**%BR%
To start the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker normally, simply restart the "<nop>OpenLink Request Broker" service.

===Testing===

You are now ready to test the connection which now requires that you read the relevant [[MultiTierQuickStart|quick start guide for client component]]  on the chosen operating system and have the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker running in (f)oreground (d)ebug mode as detailed above.

===Additional Information===

# Any changes made to c:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin\oplrqb.ini whilst the Request Broker is running will require the Request Broker to be re-initialised --%BR%
Open a "Command Prompt" window and -
