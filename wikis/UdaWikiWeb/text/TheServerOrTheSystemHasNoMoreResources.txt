These Progress/<nop>OpenEdge-specific errors usually indicate that you have exceeded the maximum number of connections allocated for the database instance.

Sometimes the number of connections has been intentionally limited (typically because of a licensing or a design constraint). 

Often, however, it is simply a misconfiguration of connection parameters, particularly including the {{{-n}}}, {{{-Ma}}}, and {{{-Mn}}} server startup parameters.  Specific advice for these values differs with the version of your DBMS engine, your environment, etc.  Please refer to your Progress documentation.

If the Progress/<nop>OpenEdge instance is running on a Unix-like OS (e.g., AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris), it is possible that you have exceeded a kernel limit such as number of semaphores or swap space. These are often configurable (or "tunable"), with different specifics depending on your particular OS.  Again, please refer to your Progress and/or OS documentation.
