= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Database Agent(s) for Sybase, for Windows =

%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements ==

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target Sybase DBMS instance and database:

* [[HowDoIFindMySybaseInstanceName|Sybase instance name]]
* [[HowDoIFindMySybaseListenPort|Sybase listen port]]
* Sybase database name
* Sybase database server hostname or IP address

== Software Requirements ==

*  There are no software requirements associated with use of the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Database Agent(s) for Sybase.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are already in use on the Broker host. These ports are the defaults used by our Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. If other services are using these, you will need to assign different (unused) ports to the new services during installation.
