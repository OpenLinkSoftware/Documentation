==Database Alias==

Database Aliases may be found in the [Database Aliases] section of the <nop>OpenLink Session Rules Book. You will also find Database Aliases in the Edit Database Aliases portion of the Administrative Assistant. 

The standard Database Alias is an abbreviation for the database to which you want to connect. For instance, {{{sports2000 = spt}}}. However, you may create regular expressions, which map many databases onto one alias. For instance, the following expression groups common Progress databases together: 
  
{{{
demo|sports|isports = pro8   
}}}

This allows you to create a single Mapping Rule, which applies in a variety of cases. This insures economy and flexibility in security. If you do not employ regular expressions, you will need to create one Mapping Rule per each database.
