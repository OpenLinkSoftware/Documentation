=ODBC to Jet Data Type Mapping for Oracle=

The following table details how the <nop>OpenLink drivers for Oracle fetch numeric data. The SQL type reported for a {{{SELECT}}} column varies depending on the native Oracle type of the column, its precision, and its scale. The <nop>OpenLink C type used to fetch the data is also shown, together with the effect of the <nop>JetFix command line switch.

Changes to the type mappings are shown in the table as italics.

=== {Notes} on the above table ===

# {{{FLOAT(b)}}} specifies a floating point number with binary precision {{{b}}}. The precision can range from 1 to 126. To convert from binary to decimal precision, multiply {{{b}}} by 0.30103.
# Possible loss of precision
# {{{FLOAT}}} specifies a floating point number with decimal precision 38, or a binary precision of 126.
# {{{NUMBER}}} specifies a floating point number with decimal precision {{{=}}} 38.
# Oracle appears to return s{{{=}}}0, p{{{=}}}0 for a calculated field
# Oracle permits a maximum precision of 38.


==Precision of <nop>OpenLink C Types==

The choice of <nop>OpenLink C type used to fetch a numeric value is determined by the maximum precision supported by the type. If a numeric type exists which can represent the data to be fetched without loss of precision, then this is used as the preferred fetch type. If a numeric type capable of supporting the required precision does not exist, then the data is fetched in character form, unless the <nop>JetFix switch is on. In this case, the data is fetched using the {{{CTYPE_FLT64}}} fetch type. This type has sufficient range to store the maximum numeric values supported by Oracle, but its use may result in a loss of precision, if the precision of the data to be fetched exceeds 15 decimal digits.
