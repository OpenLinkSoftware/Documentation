===setup.exe Program Fails to Run on Windows===

Here are some things to keep in mind when running Installshield-based installations on Windows systems:

1. Ensure that there is enough space on C: for temporary use by the installer.  Generally, at least 100MB is recommended.
 
2. Clean out the temp directories on C:, especially:

{{{
 C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\Local Settings\Temp\
 C:\Temp
}}}

3. Stop Outlook and Outlook Express, in addition to all other programs not required to be running (freeing up as much memory as possible is recommended). 

If all the above fails to resolve the problem, it's possible the machine has a corrupt installer core, or some other machine-specific problem has arisen.  Please view Installshield's knowledgebase article on troubleshooting system-related problems with Installshield v5.x-based installers:

[[http://support.installshield.com/kb/view.asp?articleid=Q100198]]

If none of the steps taken above resolve the problem, nor does any of the information in the above article address your problem, please contact <nop>OpenLink Product Support.
 
INSTALLER LOGGING
{{{----------------}}}
To monitor the progress of an <nop>OpenLink installation, you can run it in silent mode via the following command:
   setup /s 

In this mode, the installer will log the exact position it reaches in the "setup.log" file (created in same directory as "setup.exe").  If none of the above resolves your problem, we recommend you re-run the installer on the systems where it failed in silent mode.  Send the resulting "setup.log" to <nop>OpenLink Product Support.
