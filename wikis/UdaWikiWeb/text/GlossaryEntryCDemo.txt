===C++ Demo===


C++ Demo is a test application, which ships with <nop>OpenLink's <nop>WinNT drivers. C++ Demo is used to perform basic connection tests and queries. In fact, if you encounter persistent connection or SQL errors with <nop>OpenLink drivers, you want to repeat your tests with C++ Demo. Moreover, <nop>OpenLink suggests that you create traces or log files with C++ Demo, when appropriate. Use of this program helps Support staff isolate drivers or applications as the source of some problems.
