==Where is the Sybase ASA error log?==

The Sybase ASA engine enables you to enable logging by passing -zr and related logging flags along at database startup time. One value passed along with the flags is the name and location of the database log file. The following example shows a log called mydatabase.log being created in the same directory as the asademo.db database file.

{{{
dbeng9 "C:\Program Files\Sybase\SQL Anywhere 9\asademo.db" -zr all -zn 3 -zs 10 -zo mydatabase.log
}}}

Contact the Database Administrator to determine if logging was enabled at database startup time. If so, ask the administrator for the name and location of the log.
