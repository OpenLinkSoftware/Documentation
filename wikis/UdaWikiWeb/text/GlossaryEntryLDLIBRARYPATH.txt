==LD_LIBRARY_PATH==

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a standard, library environmental variable. If you install <nop>OpenLink's Data Access Drivers or Virtuoso on Unix, you want to run openlink.sh (Bourne/Bash shell) or openlink.csh (C shell). These scripts reside in your product's root directory, and they set all necessary PATH and ODBC-related variables. 

If you receive error messages--which state that libraries are missing--search your system for those libraries. If they are present, pass their paths to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. You may code the location in your shell script. Just be sure to shutdown the Broker before you re-execute that script. You may also set and export these variables from the commandline or a user's .profile. 

Finally, certain [Environment] sections of your <nop>OpenLink Session Rules Book may contain LD_LIBRARY_PATH. In this instance, you must pass your database's /lib sub-directory to that variable.
