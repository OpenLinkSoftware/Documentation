Provide a suitable DSN name and optional description for the Data Source:

<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/DSN5_DB2Name.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

The Connection Tab takes the minimum parameters required to make a connection to the target database:

<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/DSN7_DB2Host.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

* **Host** - the hostname of the server on which the DB2 database is  running

* **Port** - the TCP port on which DB2 listens

* **Database** - a valid DB2 database  alias

* **User name** - the username of a valid DB2 user


The advanced button displays additional optional parameters that can be configured.



| **Name** | **Description**| 
| **<nop>FullyMaterializeLobData** |Indicates whether the driver retrieves LOB locators for FETCH operations. The data type for this property is boolean. If the value is true, LOB data is fully materialized within the JDBC driver when a row is fetched. If this value is false, LOB data is streamed. The driver uses internal locators to retrieve LOB data in chunks on an as-needed basis. It is highly recommended that you set this value to false when you retrieve LOBs that contain large amounts of data. The default is true. |
| **<nop>ResultSetHoldability** | Specifies whether cursors remain open after a commit operation. Valid values are 1 - HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT, or 2 - CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT. |
| **<nop>CliSchema** |Specifies the schema of the DB2 shadow catalog tables or views that are searched when an application invokes a <nop>DatabaseMetaData method.|
| **<nop>CurrentSchema** | Specifies the default schema name that is used to qualify unqualified database objects in dynamically prepared SQL statements. The value of this property sets the value in the CURRENT SCHEMA special register on a server other than a DB2 UDB for z/OS server. Do not set this property for a DB2 UDB for z/OS server.|
| **<nop>CurrentSQLID** | Specifies the authorization ID that is used for authorization checking on dynamically prepared CREATE, GRANT, and REVOKE SQL statements. The owner of a table space, database, storage group, or synonym that is created by a dynamically issued CREATE statement. The implicit qualifier of all table, view, alias, and index names specified in dynamic SQL statements.|
| **<nop>CurrentFunctionPath** | Specifies the SQL path that is used to resolve unqualified data type names and function names in SQL statements that are in JDBC programs. The data type of this property is String. For a DB2 UDB for Linux, UNIX and Windows server, the maximum length is 254 bytes. The value is a comma-separated list of schema names. Those names can be ordinary or delimited identifiers. | 
| **<nop>CurrentLockTimeout** | Directs DB2 UDB for Linux, UNIX, and Windows servers to wait indefinitely for a lock or to wait for the specified number of seconds for a lock when the lock cannot be obtained immediately. The data type of this property is INT. A value of zero means no wait. A value of -1 means to wait indefinitely. A positive integer indicates the number of seconds to wait for a lock. |
| **<nop>JdbcCollection** | Specifies the collection ID for the packages that are used by an instance of the DB2 Universal JDBC Driver at run time. The data type of jdbcCollection is String. The default is NULLID. | 
| **<nop>CurrentPackageSet** | Specifies the collection ID to search for DB2 packages for the DB2 Universal JDBC Driver. The data type of this property is String. The default is NULLID. If currentPackageSet is set, its value overrides the value of jdbcCollection.|
| **<nop>CurrentPackagePath** | Specifies a comma-separated list of collections on the server. The DB2 server searches these collections for the DB2 packages for the DB2 Universal JDBC Driver. The precedence rules for the currentPackagePath and currentPackageSet properties follow the precedence rules for the DB2 CURRENT PACKAGESET and CURRENT PACKAGE PATH special registers. | 
| **<nop>SecurityMechanism** | Specifies the DRDA security mechanism. Possible values are: 3 - User ID and password, 4 - User ID only, 7 - User ID, encrypted password,9 - Encrypted user ID and password, 11 - Kerberos. If this property is specified, the specified security mechanism is the only mechanism that is used. If the security mechanism is not supported by the connection, an exception is thrown. | 
| **<nop>KerberosServerPrincipal** | For a data source that uses Kerberos security, specifies the name that is used for the data source when it is registered with the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC). |
| **<nop>DeferPrepares** | Specifies whether to defer prepare operations until run time. The data type of this property is boolean. |
| **<nop>ClientUser** | Specifies the current client user name for the connection. This information is for client accounting purposes. Unlike the connection user name, this value can change during a connection. For a DB2 UDB for Linux, UNIX, and Windows server, the maximum length is 255 bytes. |
| **<nop>ClientWorkstation** | Specifies the workstation name for the current client for the connection. This information is for client accounting purposes. This value can change during a connection. The data type of this property is String. For a DB2 UDB for Linux, UNIX, and Windows server, the maximum length is 255 bytes. |
| **<nop>ClientApplicationInformation** | Specifies application information for the current client for the connection. This information is for client accounting purposes. This value can change during a connection. The data type of this property is String. For a DB2 UDB for Linux, UNIX and Windows server, the maximum length is 255 bytes.|
| **<nop>ClientAccountingInformation** | Specifies accounting information for the current client for the connection. This information is for client accounting purposes. This value can change during a connection. The data type of this property is String. For a DB2 UDB for Linux, UNIX and Windows server, the maximum length is 255 bytes. |


As indicated above, parameters on the options and preferences tabs are not required for a basic connection:

<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/DSN10_DB2Options.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

* **Row Buffer Size** - This attribute specifies the number of records to be transported over the network in a single network hop. Values can range from 1 to 99.
    
* **Hide Login Dialog** - Suppresses the ODBC "Username" and "Password" login dialog boxes when interacting with your ODBC DSN from within an ODBC compliant application.
    
* **Read only connection** - Specifies whether the connection is "Read-only." Make sure the checkbox is unchecked to request a "Read/Write" connection.

* **Drop Catalog from Meta calls** - Enable this option to have the catalog name not appear for tables, views, and procedures when requesting database meta-data.

* **No support of quoted identifier** - If set, the call <nop>SQLGetInfo for 'SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR' will return a space (" "). It can be used if the DBMS doesn't support quoted SQL like select * from "account."

* **Drop Schema from Meta calls** - Enable this option to have the schema-name not appear for tables, views, and procedures when requesting database meta-data.

* **SQLStatistics disabled** -  Check this box to have SQLStatistics() return an empty resultset. Use this if the underlying database does not support retrieval of statistics about a table (e.g. what indexes it has).

*  **No support of search string escape** - If set, the call <nop>SQLGetInfo for 'SQL_LIKE_ESCAPE_CLAUSE' will return a space (" "). It can be used if the DBMS doesn't support SQL escape patterns.

* **Patch of NULL size of SQL_CHAR** -  If set, this option overrides the size of SQL_CHAR column type returned by the database with the value set in the text box (in bytes). With a default value of 0, the driver uses the size returned by the database.

* **SQL_DBMS Name** - Manually overrides the <nop>SQLGetInfo(SQL_DBMS_NAME) response returned by the driver. This is required for products like Microsoft <nop>InfoPath for which the return the value should be "SQL Server".

<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/DSN11_DB2Preferences.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

* **Initialization SQL** - Lets you specify a file containing SQL statements that will be run automatically against the database upon connection.

* **Cursor Sensitivity** - Enables or disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library calculates checksums for each row in the current rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already stored in the row version cache for the same rows when fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the row has been updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user's point of view, the only visible difference between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same. Deleted rows don't appear in the rowset. Updates to the row since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in the rowset, if their keys fall within the span of the rowset. If your application does not need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the 'High Cursor Sensitivity' checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the table oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the appropriate script for the target database.

* **Max rows Override** - Allows you to define a limit on the maximum number of rows to be returned from a query. The default value of 0 means no limit.
    
* **Disable autocommit** - Changes the default commit behaviour of the <nop>OpenLink driver. The default mode is <nop>AutoCommit (box unchecked).
    
* **Disable rowset size limit** - Disables a limitation enforced by the cursor library. This limitation is enforced by default. It prevents the driver from claiming all available memory in the event that a resultset  generated from an erroneous query is very large. The limit is normally never reached.
    
* **Defer fetching of long data** - Defers fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data unless explicitly requested in a query. This provides significant performance increases when fields in query do not include LONG data fields.

* **Multiple Active Statements Emulation** - Enables use of Multiple Active statements in an ODBC application even if the underlying database does not allow this, as it is emulated in the driver.
