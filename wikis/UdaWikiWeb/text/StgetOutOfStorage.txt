===stget: out of storage. (1450)===

This problem is associated with Progress. It is associated with lack of availability of space in /tmp. When a progress connection is open, it writes information to a -T parameter which is usually in /tmp folder and that could be running out of space.

You have two options, either increase space on that server for your -T param or change your -T param to point to another directory which has some more
space. To determine which is your -T parameter, have a look at your oplrqb.ini file. Locate the generic_pro83b or whichever pertains to your
configuration and check to see what the -T setting is.


Note: This problem is occasionally associated with iterative loops in code.
