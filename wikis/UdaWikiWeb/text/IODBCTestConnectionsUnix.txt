====Making a Test Connection====

Use the iodbctest sample program to test your Data Source Names (DSNs). The following example shows how this is done.

{{{
zsh, purple  3:58PM bin/ % ls
iodbc-config*  iodbcadm-gtk*  iodbctest*
zsh, purple  3:58PM bin/ % echo $ODBCINI 
/home/tim/.odbc.ini
zsh, purple  3:58PM bin/ % ./iodbctest 
iODBC Demonstration program
This program shows an interactive SQL processor

Enter ODBC connect string (? shows list): 

Progress9.x(solaris)           | OpenLink Generic ODBC Driver  
Progress10.x(solaris)           | OpenLink Generic ODBC Driver    
SQLServer                      | OpenLink Generic ODBC Driver  

Enter ODBC connect string (? shows list): DSN=<nop>SQLServer
Driver: 04.50.0801 OpenLink Generic ODBC Driver (oplodbc.so)

SQL&gt;select count(*) from timtest;

count      
-----------
100        

 result set 1 returned 1 rows.
}}}

Any of the DSN attributes in odbc.ini can be overridden in the command line connect string. Connect strings take this form

{{{
DSN=dsn_name[;attr=value]*
}}}

The attributes themselves depend on the database driver called by the DSN. Typically, attributes pass a database username and password, some form of server hostname (`host{{{=}}}' or `server{{{=}}}'), and a means to identify a database instance on that server (`database{{{=}}}'). A driver may also have custom attributes, such as <nop>FetchBufferSize, Port, etc.
