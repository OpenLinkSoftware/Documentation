===Creating a Session===

After you initialize the data source object, you must create a session object to manage the session and provide the framework needed to create a rowset with **<nop>IOpenRowset::<nop>OpenRowset**. The **<nop>IDBCreateSession::<nop>CreateSession** interface on the data source object enables you to create a new session object and returns an interface pointer to the session.

Once the session has been created, the provider must expose the interface pointer to the data source object that created the session. This interface pointer is exposed through the mandatory interface <nop>IGetDataSource.
