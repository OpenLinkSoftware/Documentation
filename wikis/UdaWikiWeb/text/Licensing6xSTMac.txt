1. Login to the machine that contains the Lite Edition driver.
2. Open your Control Panel.
3. Locate your Services utility, which may appear in Administrative Tools.
4. Open Services.
5. Locate the <nop>OpenLink License Manager in the services list.
6. Stop the License Manager.
7. Delete the old license from your machine.
