== "Domain" values ==

Historically, P21 DSNs used the Release 3.x Multi-Tier Generic Client, and passed **Progress 8** in the **Domain** field. 

Release 4.x and later Multi-Tier components use more specific Domain values, like **Progress 83B.** If the wrong Domain value is set, you may receive "Broker is unable to resolve your request" errors. This error is discussed [[BrokerIsUnableToResolveYourRequest|elsewhere in our knowledgebase]].

If you cannot determine the correct Domain value to use, open a Support Case through our [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp|online Support Center]], and we will assist you.  //There is no charge for using this system.//

== "Hostname" values ==

The **Hostname** field passes the DNS-resolvable hostname or IP address of the P21 database host (e.g., {{{p21.example.com}}}, {{{192.168.123.231}}}). 

If there is some doubt about the hostname or IP address to use in the DSN, you can usually access the AIX command-line and execute this simple command: 
{{{
hostname
}}}

This should generally return the information that you need. However, the {{{hostname}}} command may have been re-aliased in such a way that it returns inappropriate information.

If you can not determine the correct IP address or hostname, open a Support Case through our [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp|online Support Center]], and we will assist you.  //There is no charge for using this system.//

== Working with the entire P21 database schema ==

 You should generally pass the full path to one Progress database in the Database field. Here are some examples relevant to P21 --
{{{
/usr/lpp/p21pro/db/gate.db 
/usr/lpp/p21pro/db/dyn.db 
/usr/lpp/p21pro/db/gl.db 
/usr/lpp/p21pro/db/stat.db 
}}}
Along with some special C-ISAM data files, these comprise the Progress Distributed Database which is P21's data store.

You may actually want to connect to, and execute JOIN queries over, all these databases simultaneously. In that event, you should leave the database field blank. Instead, you will use [[ConfigureProgressTableview|Progress "Tableview" features]]. 

Prophet 21 installations generally include a pre-generated Parameter File, {{{/usr/lpp/openlink/dat/0/tableview.pf}}}, and associated Data file, {{{/usr/lpp/openlink/dat/0/tableview.dat}}}, for this purpose. 

The Parameter File is used by setting "Database Server", "Options", "Default Gateway," or some similar variant field (exact names vary depending on the Multi-Tier version) to **{{{-pf /usr/lpp/openlink/dat/0/tableview.pf}}}.** A related setting must also be made in the Broker Rulebook, {{{oplrqb.ini}}}, on the P21 database host.

If you have trouble establishing simultaneous connections to the distributed database or in working with some P21 tables, open a Support Case through our [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp|online Support Center]], and we will assist you.  //There is no charge for using this system.//

== Username and Password values ==

P21 databases may or may not be secured with a username and password. (Progress databases tend not to be secured, but P21 sometimes implements a proprietary authentication.) 

If you are unsure whether you need a username and password &#8212; or you do not know what the required values are &#8212; you must contact Epicor P21 Support. //We cannot help you with passwords or related user authentication information.//
