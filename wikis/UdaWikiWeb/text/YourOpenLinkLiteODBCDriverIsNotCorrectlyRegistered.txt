= Error Message: {{{Your OpenLink Lite ODBC Driver is not correctly registered}}} =

"Registration" errors typically occur if you do not have a valid license file for our Single-Tier drivers.

If you have a properly installed license file and you continue to experience registration errors, the license key may not be valid for this driver. Please [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp| create a Support Case]], and forward a copy of the license file, along with your driver version details, in response to the Case Acknowledgement email.

If you are certain that the license file is correct, you may have a corrupt Registry. For best results in such cases, you should uninstall the Single-Tier driver, remove any remaining references to the driver from your Registry, and then reinstall. Subsequent attempts to register and use the Single-Tier driver should succeed.
