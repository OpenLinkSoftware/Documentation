Ensure that the CLASSPATH environment variable is set on the machine that contains your JDBC client application. 

CLASSPATH appears in the Windows System Utility (Control Panel). Windows users need to navigate to the portion of the utility that displays their User and System settings. 

Unix users may use echo to display their CLASSPATH setting. For example: bash$ echo $CLASSPATH /home/openlink/v51/mt/jdk1.4 

CLASSPATH must pass the full path to an [[OpenLink]]  JDBC opljdbc.jar, opljdbc2.jar, opljdbc3.jar or megathin.jar, megathin2.jar file depending on your JDK.
