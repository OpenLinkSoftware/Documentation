The Single-Tier ODBC Drivers for CA-Ingres conform to the common architectural perceptions of an ODBC driver -- a single component installed on a desktop, workstation, or application server machine that depends on additional database specific networking middleware (from the relevant database vendor) for local or remote database connectivity. 

The [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier Drivers for CA-Ingres are a Type A class driver developed using the Ingres [[OpenAPI]]  call level interface and assumes the pre-installation of Ingres-Net depending on your Ingres Server release. 

These drivers are currently available for Ingres II versions 1.x, 2.x and beyond.
