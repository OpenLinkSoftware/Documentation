== What does Expression Scale do?==

Expression Scale is a Progress SQL-89/4GL configuration option. It provides an accurate value for Scale, when resultsets contain Numeric Expressions. For instance, select 10 + 12 will return the result (22) as a numeric expression.

In Progress SQL89/4GL, Scale is returned as 0 by default. Consequently, client applications may interpret numeric expressions as string data, and they may label the columns that contain the data as CHARs. This prevents mathematical manipulation of numeric values. Expression Scale removes this hinderance. Now, the user has complete control over the Scale used for numeric expressions. By default, the OpenLink drivers will return a default of 15,2 for Precision and Scale respectively. However, you can use the field to alter both respectively.
