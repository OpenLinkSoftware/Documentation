*Unix users need to ensure that openlink.sh (Bourne/Bash) or openlink.csh (C) is executed in the appropriate shell. These shell scripts set environment variables that pertain to ODBC. They appear in both client and server components installations.  
*Unix users need to run set or env to ensure that the environment variables (ODBCINI, ODBCINSTINI, etc.) are actually set.  
*All users need to ensure that the appropriate [Environment] section of the ~/openlink/bin/oplrqb.ini file contains the correct environment variables. For example: 
{{{
[Environment Informix 7.3] INFORMIXDIR = /dbs2/informix/online731 INFORMIXSERVER = openlinux DELIMIDENT = Y OPL_INF_MULTISESS = Y OPL_SPACEPADCHAR = Y CURSOR_SENSITIVITY = LOW ;FORCE_DORMANT = 1 ;FET_BUF_SIZE= 65535 ;FORCE_ONLINE_DATABASE= 1 
}}}
 
*All users should uncomment and set the [[PortHigh]]  parameter that appears in the [Protocol TCP] section of the ~/openlink/bin/oplrqb.ini file. [[PortHigh]]  should equal [[PortLow]]  + the number of concurrent connections alloted by the license + a few extra ports. For example: 
{{{
[Protocol TCP] PingWatchdog = No PingInterval = 600 Listen = 5021 PortLow = 5000 PortHigh = 5075 ;IPAddress = 127.0.0.1 
}}}
 
*All users need to start the Request Broker. The Request Broker is the oplrqb executable that appears in the /bin sub-directory of Multi-Tier server components installation. It may be started with one of the following commands: 
{{{
oplrqb # Starts process with no logging oplrqb -dv # Write debug output to the terminal oplrqb +loglevel 7 +logfile oplrqb.log # Writes debug output to a logfile 
}}}
