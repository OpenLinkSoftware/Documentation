 **Missing Libraries **  

*Search the machine for the missing library.  
*Ensure that no file or directory permissions prohibit access to found libraries.  
*Ensure that LD **LIBRARY_PATH, LIBPATH, or SHLIB_PATH pass the location of found libraries. **  
*Pass the full path to found libraries within the re-link script itself. In most cases, pass the library on the cc -s -o line. However, pass the library on the make -f line in Oracle scripts. Pass the library under $PRO_EXTRA in Progress mkdlc scripts.  
 **Missing Symbols **  

*Login to the machine.  
*cd into the database's /lib sub-directory.  
*Run the following command: nm -A *.so | grep . For example: 
{{{
nm -A *.so | grep xsendto 
}}}
 
*Record the names of files, which contain the symbols. The filename will be the first name in the nm output.  
*cd to the /lib sub-directory of the [[OpenLink]]  installation.  
*vi the script that produced the error.  
*Pass the full path to found libraries within the re-link script itself. In most cases, pass the library on the cc -s -o line. However, pass the library on the make -f line in Oracle scripts. Pass the library under $PRO_EXTRA in Progress mkdlc scripts.
