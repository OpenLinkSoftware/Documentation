===Initializing and Uninitializing the Data Source Object===

The **IDBInitialize** interface contains two methods: **Initialize** and **Uninitialize**.

Initialize enables consumers to explicitly initialize a data source object. Consumers must set properties on the data source object before attempting to initialize it; and consumers must supply a valid datasource name to the database in IDBProperties::<nop>SetProperties. If the datasource is invalid, the <nop>OpenLink provider returns an E_FAIL error on initialization.

**Uninitialize** enables consumers to return the data source object to an uninitialized state. It is an error to call **IDBInitialize::Uninitialize** when there are open sessions or rowsets on the data source object.
