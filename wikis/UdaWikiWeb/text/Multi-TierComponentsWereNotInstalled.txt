==Installation Specific Problems==
===Multi-Tier Components Were Not Installed===
**OPLCFG**

<nop>OpenLink's Multi-Tier 4.0 drivers do not ship with oplcfg. The oplcfg utility has been retired. You may now use <nop>OpenLink's Web-based Admin Assistant to configure your Database Agents and Request Broker. If you do not have access to a Web browser, you may manually configure the Request Broker and Database Agents. To proceed, vi the oplrqb.ini file which resides in the /bin sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink server components installation. Ask <nop>OpenLink Product Support, for additional information.

**Database Agents**

Some Database Agent installers do not install agent binaries. In this instance, the installer places Database Agent object code (.o) in the /lib sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink server components installation. You must use a C compiler to relink the object code against your database. Ask <nop>OpenLink Product Support.

**Other**

If you are missing another <nop>OpenLink software component, contact <nop>OpenLink Product Support. You may have a corrupt install archive.
