= Error Message: {{{Table or view does not exist}}} =

This error may indicate an ambiguous table or view name (i.e., that it appears in multiple schema or catalogs within the target DBMS), or that the table/view name is capitalized differently than your query.

This error is usually resolved by one of the following --

# Fully qualify the problematic table name, e.g., 
{{{
PUBS..Orders
}}}
# Match the case (uppercase, lowercase, mixed-case) of the table name in your query to the case of the table in the database, e.g., 
{{{
CustomerTable
}}}
# Match the case (uppercase, lowercase, mixed-case) of the table name in your query to the case of the table in the database **and** wrap the table name in double-quotes, with or without full qualification, e.g., 
{{{
"CustomerTable"
"Northwind"."sa"."Customers"
}}}
