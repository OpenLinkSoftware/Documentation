===Unicode Data Displayed as 'Junk' Characters===

<nop>OpenLink's older Data Access drivers do not support Unicode. If you query tables containing Unicode data, these older drivers may read "junk" characters from and write junk characters to your database. Be advised. If your data is stored in lower order bytes, the older Data Access drivers should function properly. However, all data stored in higher order bytes will be misinterpreted. Upgrade your drivers to resolve this problem.
