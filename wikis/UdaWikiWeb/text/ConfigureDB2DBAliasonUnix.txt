==Configure a DB2 Database Alias (Unix)==

Use the following instructions to configure DB2 database aliases on Unix and Linux operating systems:

1. Login to the machine that contains your DB2 native client software.

2. su to your DB2 instance owner. For example:

 
{{{su - db2inst1}}}
 

3.  Execute the .profile associated with the db2instance owner. For example:

 
{{{. ./.profile}}}
 
4. Use the echo command to ensure DB2DIR is set. 

 
{{{echo $DB2DIR}}}
 

5. Use the echo command to ensure DB2INSTANCE is set.

 
{{{echo $DB2INSTANCE}}}
 

6.  cd into the $DB2INSTANCE/sqllib/bin directory.

 
{{{cd $DB2INSTANCE/sqllib/bin}}}
 

7.  Execute the db2 command.

 
{{{./db2}}}
 

8. Execute the catalog node command using the following syntax.

 
{{{catalog tcpip node arbitrary_node_name remote database_server_name server db2_listening_port}}}
 

Here is an example:

 
 {{{catalog tcpip node WIN64IA remote openwin64 server 50000}}}

9. Execute the terminate command.

 
{{{terminate}}} 
 

10. Execute the catalog database command using the following syntax:

 
{{{catalog database database_name as remotedb at node arbitrary_node_name_from_above}}}
 

Here is an example:

 
{{{catalog database sample as remotedb at node WIN64IA}}}
 

11. Execute the terminate command.

 
{{{terminate}}}
 

11. Execute the connect to database command where database is the remotedb alias from step #10.  For example:

 
{{{connect to remotedb}}}
 

12. Wait for a successful connection.

Use the remotedb alias in the database alias field of your DB2 Lite Data Source Names.
