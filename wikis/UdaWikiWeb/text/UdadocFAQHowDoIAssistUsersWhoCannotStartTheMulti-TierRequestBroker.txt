Take the following action: 

*Ensure that a valid license appears in the /bin sub-directory of the [[OpenLink]]  server components installation. The broker will not start without a valid license.  
*Check directory and file permissions.  
*Compare the name of the Unix .taz files with the output of uname -a. Determine whether or not the component is compatible with the operating system.  
*Use a text editor to open the oplrqb.ini file. Locate the [Protocol TCP] Listen parameter, and take note of the port.  
*Run netstat -a and open /etc/services or C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\services to determine if the Broker's Listen port is in use by another service. This is typical of Windows XP which uses port 5000 by default.  
*Run netstat -a open /etc/services or C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\services to determine if UDP port #60001 is in use. This will affect 1.x and 3.x installations.  
*Attempt to start Windows Brokers with the Services utility and the DOS command line.  
*Determine what service packs, patches, or upgrades have been applied to the operating system. Some upgrades cause the Broker service to fail.
