===Sybase Money Data Type Interpreted as Text===
The Microsoft Jet Engine properly interprets the Microsoft SQL Server MONEY data type as CURRENCY. However, Jet wrongly interprets the Sybase MONEY data type as TEXT. As a result, <nop>OpenLink's Sybase drivers return "<nop>SQLServer" for their DBMS_NAME. This makes Access interpret Sybase MONEY data as CURRENCY. 

If Access interprets your MONEY data as TEXT, insure that you have the latest <nop>OpenLink Database Agent. You will find the latest Multi-Tier components at the following site: 

{{{
http://www.openlinksw.com/main/softdld2.htm 
}}}

If the problem persists, use a text editor to open the oplrqb.ini file which you find in the /bin sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink server components installation. Then, find the [generic_sybxx] section which corresponds to your <nop>OpenLink Sybase Agent. For example:

{{{
[generic_syb10]
Program     = syb10_mv.exe
Environment = SYBASE10
ReUse       = always
;Directory 	= c:\temp
;ConnectOptions =
;ReadOnly	=
;CommandLine	=
;Database	=
;UserID         =
;Password       =
}}}

Next, remove the semicolon (;) from CommandLine and pass +jetfix to it. For example: 

{{{
CommandLine = +jetfix 
}}}

Finally, restart or reinitialize your <nop>OpenLink Request Broker and test.
