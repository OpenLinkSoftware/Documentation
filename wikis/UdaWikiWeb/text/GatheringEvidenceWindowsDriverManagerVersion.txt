===Windows Driver Manager Version===

The following instructions will enable you to determine your Driver Manager and MDAC version: 

1. Locate your ODBC Data Sources utility (Control Panel). 
2. Click on the "About" tab. 
3. Locate the Driver Manager in the list box. 
4. Record the version information associated with the Driver Manager.
5. Forward the information to <nop>OpenLink Product Support. 

Note: If your Driver Manager version is less than 3.510.4202.0, you have outdated MDAC components. Download the latest MDAC components from the following site: 

[[http://www.microsoft.com/data/download.htm]] 

Finally, Microsoft's MDAC archives are in release 2. Do not look for a release that corresponds with the number of your Driver Manager.
