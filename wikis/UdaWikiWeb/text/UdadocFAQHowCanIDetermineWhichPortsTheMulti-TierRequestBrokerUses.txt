{{{
[Protocol TCP] PingWatchdog = No PingInterval = 600 Listen = 5000 PortLow = 5000 PortHigh = 5099 IPAddress = 127.0.0.1 
}}}

 [[OpenLink]]  's 4.x and 5.x Brokers listen on the port passed by the Listen parameter. [[OpenLink]]  's 1.x and 3.x Brokers listen on the initial port as specified by the [[PortLow]]  parameter.
