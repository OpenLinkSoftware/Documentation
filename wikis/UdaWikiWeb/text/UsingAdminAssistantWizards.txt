# Linger Timeout: The number of seconds an <nop>OpenLink Agent without connections will linger before being terminated by the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker, Specify 0 here to disable lingering. Lingering is a feature for avoiding repetative load/unload overhead of agents that are frequently used for short, quick concurrent open/close connections.
%BR%%BR%This setting is global to all agents. For specific agent settings, use the **{{{LingerTimeout}}}** value in the agent environment section.
%BR%%BR%Set Resolving of IP addresses to hostnames. The logging will show the hostname instead of the IP number if this option is selected. Switch off hostname lookup to avoid possible delays when frequently looking up unknown (new) IP numbers through a distant uncached DNS table. This parameter will have a direct affect on the type of match that is to be used for the <nop>StartupBy, <nop>ShutdownBy and <nop>ShutdownFrom parameters under the Security section.
