Unix users need to ensure that their [[OpenLink]]  and database environment variables are set. The following instructions will assist Unix users with this task: 

*Users must login to their Unix clients.  
*Users must cd into the root of their [[OpenLink]]  installation.  
*Users may run openlink.sh in a Bash or Bourne shell. Alternatively, users may run openlink.csh in a C shell.  
*Users must cd into the /bin sub-directory of their [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier installations.  
*Users must edit openlink.ini or open the file with a text editor such as vi.  
*Users must identify the **Environment ** section that corresponds to their [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier driver.  
*Users must ensure that the relevant variables are set within the **Environment ** section.
