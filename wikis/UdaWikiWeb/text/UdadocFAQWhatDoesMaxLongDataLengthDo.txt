%TOC%

   
"Max Long Data Length" controls the maximum length of SQL **LONGVARCHAR and SQL_LONGVARBINARY data returned when deferred fetching of long data is off. When off, this setting limits the amount of memory which must be allocated for a dataset cell to hold the retrieved value - the value is truncated to this length. The default limit is 60000 bytes. ** 

When deferred fetching is enabled, the complete SQL **LONGVARCHAR or SQL_LONGVARBINARY value can be fetched. Note that any value set via [[SQLSetStmtAttr]]  (SQL_ATTR_MAX_LENGTH) takes precedence over the 'Max Long Data Length' value. **
