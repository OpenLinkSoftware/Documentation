= Known Issues with the Single-Tier "Lite" Edition OLE DB Provider for ODBC Data Sources -- Visual Interdev =

* Visual Interdev uses the user name you specify at connect time as the owner qualifier when referring to schema objects. 
#* If the target database uses case-sensitive qualifiers, the case of the user name you specify when connecting must exactly match the case of the owner qualifier of schema objects belonging to that user. For instance, if using the Oracle sample user, {{{SCOTT}}}, you must connect as {{{SCOTT}}}, not as {{{scott}}}. 
#* If the incorrect case is used, Visual Interdev may fail to retrieve schema information. One manifestation of this problem is that the Query Builder may not list the columns belonging to a table.
