== Do firewall restrictions prevent a user from downloading our components? ==

# Test both <code>HTTP</code> and <code>FTP</code> links.  
# Provide a DAV link to the file.  
# Attempt to <code>FTP</code> the file to a user site.  
# Attempt to email components to the user.  
# Provide files to user via CD. (Requires Manager Approval.)  

== Do networking problems prevent transfer of a downloaded file to the target machine? ==

# Urge the user to seek assistance from the on-site network administrator.  
# Tell the user to transfer the file(s) via CD or disk.  

== Do port problems prevent Multi-tier users from starting their Request Brokers? ==

# Log in to the machine that contains the Multi-tier server components.  
# Use a text editor to open the <code>oplrqb.ini</code> file that resides in the <code>/bin</code> sub-directory of the installation.  
# Locate the <code>[Protocol TCP]</code> section.  
# Locate the <code>Listen</code> parameter. (Release 1.x and 3.x users locate <code><nop>PortLow</code>  .)  
# Close <code>oplrqb.ini</code>.  
# Run <code>netstat -a</code>.  
# If <code>Listen</code> or <code><nop>PortLow</code> is occupied, assign a new port in <code>oplrqb.ini</code>.  
# If <code>Listen</code> or <code><nop>PortLow</code> is not occupied, this may not be a port problem.  

== Do users not know what ports to pass in data source names or connect strings? ==

# Inform users that the only OpenLink-specific ports appear in the <code>[Protocol TCP]</code> section of the server component's <code>.../openlink/bin/oplrqb.ini</code> file. Any other port would be gleaned from database-related configuration files or utilities.  

== Do firewalls prevent Multi-Tier clients from contacting Multi-Tier Request Brokers? ==

# Login to the machine that contains the Multi-Tier server components.  
# Use a text editor to open the <code>oplrqb.ini</code> file that resides in the <code>/bin</code> sub-directory of the installation.  
# Locate the <code>[Protocol TCP]</code> section. For example: 
{{{
[Protocol TCP] 
PingWatchdog = No 
PingInterval = 600 
;IPAddress = 127.0.0.1 
PortLow = 5000 
PortHigh = 5020 
}}}
# Make sure <code><nop>PortHigh</code> is uncommented and set. <code><nop>PortHigh</code>  should equal <code><nop>PortLow</code>  + the number of concurrent connections granted by the license + a few extra ports.  
# Record the <code><nop>PortLow</code>  - <code><nop>PortHigh</code>  range.  
# Record the <code>Listen</code> port value. (Release 1.x and 3.x do not have Listen.)  
# Close <code>oplrqb.ini</code>.  
# Open the <code>Listen</code> and <code><nop>PortLow</code>  - <code><nop>PortHigh</code>  TCP ports on the firewall.  
# Open UDP port <code>60001</code> -- in addition to those above -- to accommodate Release 1.x and Release 3.x drivers.  

== Do Multi-Tier port settings restrict the number of concurrent connections? ==

# Login to the machine that contains the Multi-Tier server components.  
# Use a text editor to open the <code>oplrqb.ini</code> file that resides in the <code>/bin</code> sub-directory of the installation.  
# Locate the <code>[Protocol TCP]</code> section. For example: 
{{{
[Protocol TCP] 
PingWatchdog = No 
PingInterval = 600 
;IPAddress = 127.0.0.1 
PortLow = 5000 
PortHigh = 5020 
}}}
# Make sure <code><nop>PortHigh</code> is uncommented and set. <code><nop>PortHigh</code>  should equal <code><nop>PortLow</code>  + the number of concurrent connections granted by the license + a few extra ports.  
# Save changes and exit the file.  
# Restart or reinitialize the Request Broker and test.
