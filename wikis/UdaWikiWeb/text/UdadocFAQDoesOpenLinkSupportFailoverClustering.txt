Multi-Tier users must install one set of [[OpenLink]]  server components (Request Broker & Database Agent) on each node. The fail-over Broker may be instantiated by shell scripts, cron, or some other startup procedure, when the active node goes down. 

Some environments may support multiple, running Request Brokers, so long as each Request Broker can bind to a unique IP address.
