It is possible your machine might contain a copy of the [[OpenLink]]  Software Universal Data Access drivers or you might require one or more additional components -e.g., clients or agents-to match pre-existing software. To locate whether there is an existing installation on your machine, use the following instructions to search for [[OpenLink]]  products: 

*Obtain the operating system of the machine or machines that may contain [[OpenLink]]  software.  
*UNIX users should use find / -name -print to search for the following files: oplrqb, oplodbc.so.*, openlink.ini.  
*Windows users should use Windows Explorers and search for oplrqb.exe, olod*.dll, or lite32.  
Retrieval of one or more of the aforementioned files confirms the presence of [[OpenLink]]  's Multi-Tier or Single-Tier drivers. Consequently, you must obtain the product's version string and attempt to match any new components to the pre-existing build. 

Absence of the above files suggests that a user has no software or an incomplete software installation. You will need to do a fresh installation.
