==Where is the Oracle error log?==

Oracle's database error logs have the following naming convention:

{{{
alertORACLE_ SID.log
}}}

These logs usually appear in $ORACLE_ BASE/admin/ORACLE_ SID/bdump. Alternatively, the location of this file is passed by the dump_dest parameter which appers in Oracle's init.ora file.
