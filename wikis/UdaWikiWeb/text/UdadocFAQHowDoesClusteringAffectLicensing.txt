>Single-Tier users must license each individual Single-Tier installation. 

Multi-Tier users must obtain a distinct license for each running Request Broker. Hence, all load balancing architectures require two or more Request Broker licenses. Fail-over architectures may share one license, so long as only one Request Broker runs at a time. However, some fail-over architectures may require or benefit from multiple licenses. 

Note:Please contact your Account Manager for more information on your Clustering License needs
