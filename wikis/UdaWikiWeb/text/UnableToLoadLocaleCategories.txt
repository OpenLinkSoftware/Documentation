= Error Message: {{{Unable to load locale categories}}} =

Missing or incorrectly set Informix environment variables can lead to "Unable to load locale categories" errors. To remedy this problem, take the following action:

# Log in to the physical Informix database server as the Informix owner (typically userid {{{informix}}}). 
#* If your Informix host is Unix or Linux-based, review the Informix user's {{{.profile}}} or similar to see what variables are being set, and to what values. 
#* If your Informix host is Windows-based, run <nop>SetNet32. Then, click on the Environment tab of the <nop>SetNet32 dialog box. Determine the same information.
# Use a text editor to open the active Rulebook (typically, {{{oplrqb.ini}}} found alongside the {{{oplrqb}}} executable).
# Locate the {{{[Environment INFORMIX*]}}} section which corresponds to your active database agent. For example:
{{{
[Environment INFORMIX72]
INFORMIXSERVER = alpha
INFORMIXDIR = /dbs/informix72
DELIMIDENT = Y ; Allow quoted identifiers
OPL_INF_MULTISESS = Y ; Allow multiple sessions
OPL_SPACEPADCHAR = Y ; Pad CHAR fields with spaces
CURSOR_SENSITIVITY = LOW ; Set to HIGH after loading oplrvc.sql
}}}
# Set {{{INFORMIXDIR}}}, {{{INFORMIXSERVER}}}, {{{ONCONFIG}}}, and {{{TBCONFIG}}}, as appropriate. You may also need to add a parameter setting, such as {{{CLIENT_LOCALE = en_US.819}}}. Different versions of Informix databases recognize and require different combinations of variables.
# Save your changes, and exit the file.
# Restart or reinitialize your Request Broker.

This should remedy the problem. If it does not, the active Informix Database Agent may not be fully compatible with your Informix database.  [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp|Contact us]] for more assistance.
