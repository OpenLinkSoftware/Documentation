Use the following guidelines: 

*Ensure that users have applied all, current operating system patches.  
*Determine whether or not the DBMS requires a specific patch level.  
*Ascertain whether patches are associated with issues presented by the user.  
*Compare the user patch level to the [[OpenLink]]  build server patch level. [[OpenLink]]  's build servers may require patch updates, if they are behind user patch levels. Users may need patch updates, if they are behind [[OpenLink]]  's patch level. Otherwise, discrepancies between the machines may contribute to compatibility and stability problems.
