===Data Source Attributes===

Data Source Attributes are the values which you pass in your <nop>OpenLink Data Sources or DSN's. Data Source Attributes may be found in one of two places:

1. Windows Client Data Sources - Open your client's ODBC Data Sources Administrator. You will find your Data Source Name on the User, System, or File tab. Highlight your Data Source and click "Configure." You will now see your attributes.

2. Unix Client Data Sources - Use the cd command to enter the /bin sub-directory of your Virtuoso or Multi-Tier installation. Use a text editor to open the odbc.ini file. Find your Data Source in the list. For example:

{{{
$ cd /usr/openlink/bin
$ vi odbc.ini

[OpenLink]
Driver          = /home/openlink/lib/oplodbc.sl.1
Description     = Sample OpenLink DSN
Host            = nkhatam
ServerType      = SQLServer 7
FetchBufferSize = 99
UserName        = sa
Password        =
Database        = Northwind
}}}

Finally, copy your Data Source attributes and forward them to <nop>OpenLink Product Support.
