The Single-Tier ODBC Drivers for Sybase conform to the common architectural perceptions of an ODBC driver -- a single component installed on a desktop, workstation, or application server machine. 

The [[OpenLink]]  Single-Tier Drivers for Sybase are a Type B class of driver developed using the Sybase TDS network (wire) protocol interface eliminating the need for the installation of any Sybase specific client networking software. 

The drivers are currently available for Sybase ASE versions 4.9, 11, 12 and beyond; also Sybase ASA version 6.x and beyond.
