URL's have become the default way of accessing documents and applications. Application servers and databases therefore need to make resources accessible in a URL namespace. Virtuoso offers a built-in Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning . ( [[WebDAV]]  ) repository capable of hosting static and many types of dynamic content. 

 [[WebDAV]]  resources are controlled by a Unix-like security scheme where SQL accounts and roles are associated to resources and collections. The server-wide URL namespace can be mapped across multiple HTTP listeners, providing isolation and HTTPS access for selected points. These [[WebDAV]]  resources are stored in a relational table, making it easy for applications to produce and alter [[WebDAV]]  resources. 

Besides documents, [[WebDAV]]  can host dynamic content in ASP .Net, PHP 4, JSP, Virtuoso's native VSPX web page language and others. Also, XML reports generated from relational or XQuery queries may be directly published in DAV without any programming. Because DAV resources are in a database, these are covered by database backups and transaction logging and can be replicated using Virtuoso's replication capabilities. Additionally, text and XML resources get automatically indexed in the repository's full text index for fast retrieval. 

Virtuoso [[WebDAV]]  can be used as a file server for a number of web-authoring tools that support publishing and exporting of content to [[WebDAV]]  ; as well as for operating systems that have a DAV file system driver. For example, Windows XP and Mac OSX applications and desktops can transparently manipulate data in Virtuoso DAV.
