= Pre-Installation Requirements for the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Database Agent(s) for <nop>PostgreSQL, for Windows =

%TOC%

== DBMS Requirements ==

You need to know a variety of information pertaining to your target <nop>PostgreSQL DBMS instance and database:

* [[HowDoIFindMyPostgreSQLListeningPort|<nop>PostgreSQL TCP port]]
* Hostname or IP address of the <nop>PostgreSQL database server

== Software Requirements ==

*  There are no software requirements associated with use of the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Database Agent(s) for <nop>PostgreSQL.

== Configuration Requirements ==

* You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are already in use on the Broker host. These ports are the defaults used by our Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant. If other services are using these, you will need to assign different (unused) ports to the new services during installation.
