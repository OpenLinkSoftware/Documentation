=== Configuration ===

<nop>OpenLink's server components require minimal configuration. In most instances, the installation process includes steps to ensure that the primary configuration file (oplrqb.ini) is configured for basic connectivity. Use the following steps to check and enhance your individual agent settings.

Launch the Multi-Tier Administrative Assistant in a Web browser. The URL convention is:
<BR>

 {{{http://}}}//ip_address_of_machine_with_mt_server components:mt_admin_port//
<BR>
<BR> <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Open_Admin.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

Click the Server Components Administration link.
<BR>
<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ServerComponents.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

Click the Database Agent Administration link.
<BR>
<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/AgentAdministration.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

Click the Database Settings by Wizard link.
<BR>
<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/DatabaseWizard.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

Login with your Administrative username and password. Both default to admin.

<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/AdminLogin.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

Select the configuration section that you want to review. The naming convention for default database agent configuration sections is //generic_// followed by an abbreviation for the <nop>OpenLink agent.

<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/AgentConfiguration.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

The Agent Details  dialog allows you to rename the default agent configuration section and provide an optional comment. This is an advanced feature that should not be pursued for basic connectivity. 
<BR>
<BR> <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/AgentDetails1.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

Click Edit to continue.

The first Connection Parameters dialog allows you to hardcode a single username and password for all connections that use this agent configuration section for ODBC connectivity. 
<BR>
 <BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ConnectionParameters.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

* **User Name** - A valid database uid. 

* **Password**- A valid database password.

Click Next to continue.

The second Connection Parameters dialog allows you to hardcode a single Database, Read/Write access mode, and Connection Options for **all** connections that use this agent configuration section for ODBC connectivity.
<BR>
<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ConnectionParameters2.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

* **Database Name**- Takes a database name or Oracle SID. 

* **Read Only specifier**- Specifies whether the connection is Read-only or Read/Write. 

* **Connect Options**- This field passes parameters that enable users to connect to <nop>MySQL, <nop>PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Sybase databases anywhere on the network. It also passes parameters that enable users to connect to any DBMS that does not reside on the same machine as the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker and Agent. [[MTServerConfigConnectOptions|Review Complete Settings and Usage for Connect Options]]


Click Next to continue.

The second Connection Parameters dialog allows you to hardcode Server Options, a Domain, and a Host Name for all connections that use this agent configuration section for ODBC connectivity.
<BR>
 <BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ConnectionParameters3.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

* **Server Options**- Server Options are typically Progress specific options which are passed to the database at startup. You want to ensure that the options passed to the actual database match the options passed in the Server Options field or <nop>ServerOptions parameter.   These options must also match actual options passed to the database at startup time.

* **Domain**- The value must match a [Domain Alias], which is contained in the Server's Session Rules Book. This Alias typically represents the name and version of an <nop>OpenLink Agent. That agent version may differ from the DBMS version to which it connects. Note that advanced users may create custom domain names that follow their own, desired conventions.   

* **Host Name**- Host name or IP address of the machine that contains the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker.

Click Next to continue.

The Secure SSL Connection dialog allows you to designate an SSL certificate. It also allows you to enforce SSL-only connectivity. 
<BR>
<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/SecureSSL.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

* **SSL Key File**- Passes the location of an SSL certificate.

* **SSL Required** - Check to force the broker to accept only SSL-based connections.

Click Next to continue.

The first Application & Database Specific Parameters dialog allows you to enable opsyslogin. Opsyslogin forces connections to authenticate their usernames and passwords against the operating system instead of the database.
<BR>
<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Specific1.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

* **Require Operating System Identity**- If checked, the Request Broker will test to see that the username and password which are supplied to it are valid for the machine. If the authentication parameters are valid, it will start the database agent under the identity of the user. If unchecked, the username and password will be passed to the backend database for authentication.  

Click Next to continue.

The second Application & Database Specific Parameters dialog allows you to disable autocommit and enable Jet Engine catalogs. 
<BR>
 <BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Specific2.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

* **No auto commit on startup**- Changes the default commit behaviour of the <nop>OpenLink driver. The default mode is <nop>AutoCommit (box unchecked).

* **Jet engine catalogs**- Check this checkbox if you intend to use this driver with Microsoft Access. This option facilitates translation of certain datatypes by the Microsoft Jet Engine. If you utilize MS applications, and you notice that money and other datatypes are mishandled, test with +jetfix.

Click Next to continue.

The third Application & Database Specific Parameters dialog allows you to limit your rowset size and pass an initial SQL script.
<BR>
<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Specific3.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

* **Limit result set to //n// records**- Allows you to define a limit on the maximum number of rows to be returned from a query. The default value of 0 means no limit.

* **Initial SQL script**- Lets you specify a file containing SQL statements that will be run automatically against the database upon connection.

Click Next to continue.

The Startup parameters screen enables you to identify the <nop>OpenLink database agent to use for your ODBC connections. It also allows you to hardcode specific environment variables for the connection. Proper environment variables are essential for ODBC connectivity.
<BR>
 <BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Startup.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

* **Executable name**- Allows you to choose which <nop>OpenLink agent should serve all connections associated with this agent configuration section.

* **Environment Variables**- <nop>OpenLink's agents are written using the database native CLI.  Consequently, they use the same environment variables that database native clients use to connect to the relevant DBMS. Use this box to set them.

The Process Mapping dialog enables you to set your agent reuse rules. Reuse rules dictate whether or not an agent will be used for subsequent connections. Reuse of agents reduces overhead associated with agent spawning.
<BR>
<BR><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ProcessMapping.png" style="wikiautogen"/>

Click Next to continue.

The Save Settings dialog allows you to save your new agent settings. Check the Reinitialize checkbox to reinitialize the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker with these settings. Your new settings will not be unforced unless the Request Broker is restarted or reinitialized.
<BR>
