A variety of factors contribute to the "Network failure" error. If you encounter network failures, take the action that corresponds to the operating system on which the Broker is running:

==For a Unix Broker host==

# Log into the problem machine.
# Run {{{ps -ef}}} and make sure that {{{oplmgr}}}, {{{oplrqb}}}, and {{{www_sv}}} are not running. Kill any relevant processes. For example:
{{{
ps -ef | grep oplmgr
ps -ef | grep oplrqb
ps -ef | grep www_sv
}}}
# {{{cd}}} to the root of your <nop>OpenLink installation, where you find {{{openlink.sh}}} and {{{openlink.csh}}}.
# Set the <nop>OpenLink environment by running the appropriate script for your shell --
| *shell* | *command* |
| <code>sh, bash, zsh</code> and related | <code><nowiki>. ./openlink.sh</nowiki></code> |
| <code>ksh</code> and related | <code><nowiki>source ./openlink.sh</nowiki></code> |
| <code>csh, tcsh</code> and related | <code><nowiki>source ./openlink.csh</nowiki></code> |
# {{{cd}}} into the {{{bin}}} sub-directory of your <nop>OpenLink installation.
# Use {{{ls -al}}} to insure that {{{oplrqb.log}}} is writable by its owner.
# {{{vi oplrqb.ini}}}
# Locate the {{{[Protocol TCP]}}} section. For example:
{{{
[Protocol TCP]
PingWatchdog = No
PingInterval = 600
Listen = 5000
PortLow = 5000
PortHigh = 6000
;IPAddress = 127.0.0.1

# Remove the semicolon from the <code><nowiki>IPAddress</nowiki></code> parameter.
# Hardcode your machine's IP address.
# Record the value passed to <code><nowiki>Listen</nowiki></code>.
# Exit the file.
# Run <code><nowiki>netstat -a</nowiki></code> to insure that UDP and TCP ports <code><nowiki>60001</nowiki></code> are free. For example:
{{{
netstat -a &#x7c; grep 60001
}}}
# Run <code><nowiki>netstat -a</nowiki></code> to insure that the TCP port passed to Listen is free. For example:
{{{
netstat -a &#x7c; grep 5000
}}}
# Run {{{./oplmgr -?}}} to insure that you do not have version 0.9.4. If you do, you have a bug, and you must stop and contact <nop>OpenLink Product Support. For example:

# Use {{{ls -al}}} to make sure that all files in {{{~/openlink/bin}}} and {{{~/openlink/lib}}} have file ownership.
# Remove any files named {{{.opl*}}} or {{{opl*}}} in {{{/tmp}}} --
{{{
rm /tmp/.opl* /tmp/opl*

# Start your Request Broker process.
# Test your connection.

If the same error persists send the following resources to <nop>OpenLink Product Support:

# Copies of your {{{oplrqb.lic}}}, {{{oplrqb.log}}}, and {{{oplrqb.ini}}} files
# The output of the various commands suggested above
# The output of these additional commands --

==For a Windows Broker host==

# Log into the problem machine.
# Use the Services utility to insure that the <nop>OpenLink License Manager and <nop>OpenLink Request Broker are shut down. 
# Use the Task Manager to make sure that www_sv is not running. Kill any relevant processes.
# Expand your **Start** -> **Programs** menu.
# Expand the <nop>OpenLink Data Access Drivers folder.
# Click the Session Rules Book entry. This should open the {{{oplrqb.ini}}} file (a.k.a. Session Rules Book) in Notepad.
# Locate the {{{[Protocol TCP]}}} section. For example:
