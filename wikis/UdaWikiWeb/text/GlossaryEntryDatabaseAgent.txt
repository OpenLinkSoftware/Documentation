==Database Agent ==

A database Agent is the only database-specific component in <nop>OpenLink's Multi-Tier architecture. In fact, these agents are built against a database's CLI. When the <nop>OpenLink Request Broker receives a connection request, it spawns the appropriate agent. Then, the agent retrieves data from the database and returns it to the calling client.
