<para>The Admin Assistant writes the following information to a file, when startup is successful:</para><programlisting>					Thu Mar 04 2004
15:07:11 started http://openlinux.openlinksw.com:8051
</programlisting><para> Here, we see the URL through which a Web browser may access the Admin Assistant.
 The first part of the URL designates the machine (<computeroutput>openlinux.openlinksw.com</computeroutput>) on which it started.
 The number appended to the end of the machine (<computeroutput>:8051</computeroutput>) is the TCP port on which it listens.
 This is set by the <computeroutput>HTTPServer</computeroutput> value in the <computeroutput>www_sv.ini</computeroutput> file.
 The <computeroutput>www_sv.ini</computeroutput> file is generally found in the <computeroutput>/bin/w3config</computeroutput> sub-directory of OpenLink Multi-Tier server installations, but the directory may be changed with the <computeroutput>Directory</computeroutput> keyword in the <computeroutput>[www_sv]</computeroutput> stanza of the Session Rulebook.</para><para>The Admin Assistant will write simple error messages to the log when startup fails.
 Specific error messages and their meanings and resolutions are documented elsewhere.</para><para>We have been discussing the default log produced by the Admin Assistant (log level 5).
 However, you can cause the Admin Assistant to run at different log levels, by setting the log level in the <computeroutput>[www_sv]</computeroutput> stanza of the Session Rulebook.
 For example:</para><programlisting>[www_sv]
Program	  = w3config/www_sv
Directory	= w3config
CommandLine =  +loglevel 6
</programlisting><para> Log level 7 causes the Admin Assistant to output an HTTP log that display individual scripts and images as it serves them.
 Be sure to look for errors interspersed between the entries.
