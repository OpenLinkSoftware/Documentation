<para>This error is most commonly seen with our pre-Release 4.2 drivers, and is generally resolved by upgrading/updating to Release 4.2 or later.
 Thus, please upgrade to the latest version covered by your active license.</para><para>More recently, this error has been associated with internal Type Handling and Type Representation, tied to disparities between the libraries against which our components are built, and the libraries found on the deployment host(s).
 If this is the issue you&#39;re seeing, some environment variables (i.e., <computeroutput>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>LIBPATH</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>SHLIB_PATH</computeroutput>) may be set to target incorrect library directories.
 <ulink url="RelinkMulti-TierDatabaseAgents">Relinking the &quot;Enterprise&quot; Edition Database Agent</ulink> to specifically reference your local DBMS and other libraries may also be necessary.</para><para>If the problem persists after relinking, <ulink url="GeneratingClientsideODBCTracesAllDrivers">generate a client-side ODBC trace</ulink>.
 This trace may reveal a new cause of these errors.</para></section></docbook>
