<para>A database Agent is the only database-specific component in OpenLink&#39;s Multi-Tier architecture.
 In fact, these agents are built against a database&#39;s CLI.
 When the OpenLink Request Broker receives a connection request, it spawns the appropriate agent.
 Then, the agent retrieves data from the database and returns it to the calling client.
