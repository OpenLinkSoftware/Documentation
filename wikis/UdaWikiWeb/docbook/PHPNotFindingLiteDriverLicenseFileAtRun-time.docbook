<para>The Single-Tier drivers for Unix (Unix Lite) need to find the .lic file at runtime/connect-time, so to that end the &quot;openlink.sh&quot; script, when run, should set the $PATH appropriately such that installation&#39;s &quot;bin&quot; directory is found.
 However, since PHP sets its own environment variable at run-time, the $PATH environment variable needs to be set appropriately in the PHP script (via the &quot;putenv&quot; function), e.g.:</para><programlisting>    putenv(&quot;PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/odbc/bin&quot;);
</programlisting><para> In addition, the PHP author should also ensure that the user &quot;nobody&quot; which is the user who typically owns the Apache process, has read and execute privileges on the .lic file whereever it resides (typically in the OpenLink &#39;bin&#39; directory).</para><para>If problems persist, helpful information is contained in the HTML output of a &quot;phpinfo()&quot; command, as well as full &quot;ls -al&quot; output on all the relevant OpenLink installation directories.
