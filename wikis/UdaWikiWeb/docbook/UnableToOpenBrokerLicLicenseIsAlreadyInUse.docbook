<para>This error has two common causes.</para><bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h2"> 1 - License Manager does not have sufficient access to TCP/IP network communications </bridgehead>
<para>Resolution typically requires <ulink url="OplmgrNetworking">opening a few ports in the License Manager host&#39;s firewall</ulink>.</para><bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h2"> 2 - Multiple hosts have the same serialized license file </bridgehead>
<para>Resolution simply requires that each licensed host have a uniquely serialized license file -- that is, that each serial number is found on only one host.
 After you&#39;ve confirmed license file uniqueness, restart all OpenLink-related processes, most importantly the License Manager, and this error should cease.
