<para>32-bit software components may generally be used on 64-bit operating systems, where the operating system and hardware support 32-bit components.
 Virtually every 64-bit Mac or Windows environment supports both 64-bit and 32-bit software components.</para><para>Exceptions include early Itanium systems, which only supported 64-bit software components, and 64-bit Linux environments which lack the 32-bit &quot;shim&quot; libraries necessary for 32-bit support.</para><para>Our 32-bit components may be used with 64-bit databases for which 32-bit client libraries are available, or where database-native client libraries are not required (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase).
