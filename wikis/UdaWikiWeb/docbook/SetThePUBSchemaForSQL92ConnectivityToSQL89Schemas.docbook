<para>When using SQL-92 drivers for Progress, you may find that queries using single-element identifiers which worked fine with the SQL-89 drivers, e.g., -- </para><programlisting>SELECT * FROM tablename
</programlisting><para>-- now require use of the <computeroutput>PUB</computeroutput> owner identifier, e.g., -- </para><programlisting>SELECT * FROM PUB.tablename
</programlisting><para> This is due to a number of changes in the underlying Progress layers, from SQL-89 to SQL-92.</para><bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h2"> Solution </bridgehead>
<para>This can generally be worked around by using our &quot;<emphasis>Initial SQL</emphasis>&quot; option.</para><para>This solution removes the need to prefix identifiers in new queries with &quot;<computeroutput>PUB.</computeroutput>&quot;, but any queries which already include the prefix should continue to work just fine.</para><para>Simply create a text file, e.g., <computeroutput>openlink.sql</computeroutput>, containing the following line -- </para><programlisting>SET SCHEMA &#39;PUB&#39;;
</programlisting><para> <emphasis><emphasis>Note: </emphasis>In some environments, varying with the precise version of the Progress and OpenLink components in use, the trailing semicolon may need to be removed, changing the file content to --</emphasis> </para><programlisting>SET SCHEMA &#39;PUB&#39;
