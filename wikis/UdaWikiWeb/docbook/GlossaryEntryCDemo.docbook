<para> C++ Demo is a test application, which ships with OpenLink&#39;s WinNT drivers.
 C++ Demo is used to perform basic connection tests and queries.
 In fact, if you encounter persistent connection or SQL errors with OpenLink drivers, you want to repeat your tests with C++ Demo.
 Moreover, OpenLink suggests that you create traces or log files with C++ Demo, when appropriate.
 Use of this program helps Support staff isolate drivers or applications as the source of some problems.
