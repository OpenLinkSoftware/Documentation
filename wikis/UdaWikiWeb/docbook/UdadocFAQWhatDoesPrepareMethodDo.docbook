<para> This option is specific to the TDS Driver for MS &amp; Sybase SQLServers, and can take the values None, Partial and Full (connectoptions -O [0, 1, 2] respectively) which are used to determines whether stored procedures are created on the server for calls to SQLPrepare.</para><para>When set to Full (-O 2), stored procedures are created for every call to SQLPrepare.
 This setting can result in decreased performance when processing statements that do not contain parameters.</para><para>When set to Partial (-O 1) (the initial default), the driver creates stored procedures only if the statement contains parameters.
 Otherwise, the statement is cached and run directly at the time of SQLExecute.</para><para>When set to None (-O 0), stored procedures are never created.
 The driver caches the statement, executes it directly at the time of SQLExecute, and reports any syntax or similar errors at the time of SQLExecute.</para><para> </para></section></docbook>
