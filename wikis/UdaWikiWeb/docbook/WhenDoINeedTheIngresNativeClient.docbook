<para>There are two scenarios in which you would require the Ingres native client.
 You must install the Ingres client on the same machine as any Ingres Single-Tier driver.
 Additionally, you must install the Ingres client on the same machine as OpenLink&#39;s Multi-Tier Request Broker and Ingres Database Agent, if the Broker and Ingres Agent do not reside on the same machine as the Ingres database.
