<para>Here are some things to keep in mind when running Installshield-based installations on Windows systems:</para><para>1.
 Ensure that there is enough space on C: for temporary use by the installer.
 Generally, at least 100MB is recommended.</para><para>2.
 Clean out the temp directories on C:, especially:</para><programlisting> C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\Local Settings\Temp\
 C:\Temp
</programlisting><para> 3.
 Stop Outlook and Outlook Express, in addition to all other programs not required to be running (freeing up as much memory as possible is recommended).</para><para>If all the above fails to resolve the problem, it&#39;s possible the machine has a corrupt installer core, or some other machine-specific problem has arisen.
 Please view Installshield&#39;s knowledgebase article on troubleshooting system-related problems with Installshield v5.x-based installers:</para><para><ulink url="http://support.installshield.com/kb/view.asp?articleid=Q100198">http://support.installshield.com/kb/view.asp?articleid=Q100198</ulink></para><para>If none of the steps taken above resolve the problem, nor does any of the information in the above article address your problem, please contact OpenLink Product Support.</para><para>INSTALLER LOGGING <computeroutput>----------------</computeroutput> To monitor the progress of an OpenLink installation, you can run it in silent mode via the following command:    setup /s</para><para>In this mode, the installer will log the exact position it reaches in the &quot;setup.log&quot; file (created in same directory as &quot;setup.exe&quot;).
 If none of the above resolves your problem, we recommend you re-run the installer on the systems where it failed in silent mode.
 Send the resulting &quot;setup.log&quot; to OpenLink Product Support.
