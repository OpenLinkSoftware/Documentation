<para>OpenLink JDBC Bench is an open source utility for benchmark testing OpenLink and non-OpenLink JDBC drivers using tests based on the TPC-A and TPC-C suites.
 OpenLink JDBC Bench is highly configurable.
 It enables users to benchmark drivers side-by-side using differing numbers of threads, cursor modalities, and transaction isolation levels.
 Use of array optimization and certain JDBC API calls is also configurable.
 Output can be directed to screen, plain text files, XML files, or database tables.
