<para>OpenLink Single-Tier Drivers are clientside-only ODBC and JDBC-ODBC Bridge drivers.
 They involve minimal installation and configuration.
 They are ideal for new and non-technical users, and they should be advanced before other drivers in the product portfolio.
 However, most Single-Tier drivers are not self-sufficient.
 They require the database native communications layer to connect.
 TDS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Mac OS X Oracle drivers are an exception.
 These drivers include bundled libraries which allow them to connect to target databases without the addition of a database native layer.
