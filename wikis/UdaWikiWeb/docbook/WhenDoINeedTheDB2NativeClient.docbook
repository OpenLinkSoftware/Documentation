<para>There are two scenarios in which you would require the DB2 native client.
 You must install the DB2 client on the same machine as any DB2 Single-Tier driver.
 Additionally, you must install the DB2 client on the same machine as OpenLink&#39;s Request Broker and DB2 Database Agent, if the Broker and DB2 Agent do not reside on the same machine as the DB2 database.
