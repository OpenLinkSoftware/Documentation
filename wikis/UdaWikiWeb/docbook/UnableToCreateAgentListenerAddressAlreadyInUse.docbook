<para>&quot;Unable to create agent listener&quot; errors are returned when all ports allocated for agent use (i.e., all ports between <computeroutput>PortLow</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>PortHigh</computeroutput>, as set in the active Rulebook) are in use by other processes (including other agent instances) when the Broker tries to launch a new Agent instance.</para><para>If you encounter such errors --</para><orderedlist spacing="compact"><listitem> Access the Multi-Tier server components installation.
</listitem>
<listitem> Use a text editor to open your active Rulebook (default, <computeroutput>oplrqb.ini</computeroutput>).
 You will generally find this file in the <computeroutput>bin</computeroutput> sub-directory of your OpenLink server components installation.
</listitem>
<listitem> Locate the <computeroutput>[Protocol TCP]</computeroutput> section.
</listitem>
<listitem> Note the values set for <computeroutput>PortLow</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>PortHigh</computeroutput>.
 Ensure that this range is at least as large as the maximum number of agent instances you will have running simultaneously.
 We generally recommend allocating an additional 10-100 ports to this range, to allow unrelated processes to consume some ports as assigned by the OS.

<listitem> Save the Rulebook, restart the Broker, and monitor for recurrence of the error.</listitem>
