<para> This is a Progress SQL-89 specific option which if set the driver returns &quot; &quot; rather than &quot;&quot; to represent this database does not have a quoted identifier character.
 The ODBC specification says that &quot; &quot; is what should be returned but some applications (like Crystal Reports) interpret this response as meaning the quoted identifier character is a &quot;space&quot;, which obviously does not make sense and fails, as they are expecting &quot;&quot; to be returned hence this need for this option.</para><para> </para></section></docbook>
