<para>There are two scenarios in which you would require the Oracle native client.
 You must install the Oracle client on the same machine as any Oracle Single-Tier driver.
 Additionally, you must install the Oracle client on the same machine as OpenLink&#39;s Multi-Tier Request Broker and Oracle Database Agent, if the Broker and Oracle Agent do not reside on the same machine as the Oracle database.
