<para>OpenLink ODBC Bench is an open source utility for benchmark testing OpenLink and non-OpenLink ODBC drivers using tests based on the TPC-A and TPC-C suites.
 OpenLink ODBC Bench is highly configurable.
 It enables users to benchmark drivers side-by-side using differing numbers of threads, cursor modalities, and transaction isolation levels.
 Use of array optimization and certain ODBC API calls is also configurable.
 Output can be directed to screen, plain text files, XML files, or database tables.
