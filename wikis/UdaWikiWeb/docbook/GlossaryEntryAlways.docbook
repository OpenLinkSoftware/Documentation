<para>Always is a Multi-Tier server component setting; specifically, it is a setting for the Agent &quot;Reuse&quot; value, and is found in the [generic_<computeroutput>&lt;Agent&gt;</computeroutput>] section of the oplrqb.ini file (where <computeroutput>&lt;Agent&gt;</computeroutput> corresponds to the database Agent alias matching your database.)</para><para>&quot;Always&quot; specifies that all client connections will be serviced by the same Database Agent process.
 You may also wish to enforce a conditional Database Agent &quot;Reuse&quot; setting.
 For example, after an Agent has accepted a certain number of connections, the Request Broker can spawn a new Agent process based on a conditional Reuse limit you impose.</para><para>Agent reuse rules are configurable via the Admin Assistant (typically running at <ulink url="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</ulink> on the Multi-Tier server component host machine), in the Database Agent settings section of the Server Components Administration.</para><para>Example:</para><programlisting>   [generic_ora81]
