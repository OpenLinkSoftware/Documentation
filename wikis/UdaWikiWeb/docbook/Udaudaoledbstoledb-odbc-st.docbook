<para>  OLE DB Provider for ODBC The OLE DB to ODBC Provider is implemented as an OLEDB - ODBC bridge provider, utilizing ODBC data sources for connectivity to databases, much like the Microsoft ODBC Provider.</para><para>The <ulink url="OpenLink">OpenLink</ulink>  OLEDB provider is a Type-C class provider bound to the ODBC Driver Manager enabling the connectivity to any ODBC Data source including the <ulink url="OpenLink">OpenLink</ulink>  Multi-Tier and Single-Tier or any third party ODBC driver.</para><para>  [[/images/oledbodbcst.gif|]]</para><para> /OLE DB to ODBC Provider Architecture Diagram Image scaled down; Click to enlarge./
