<para>OpenLink will introduce support for JDBC connection pooling in the near future.
 In the interim, the JDBC agents do not provide direct support for this 2.0 extension.
 Instead, OpenLink 4.0 provides multi-threading across the client and server tier.
 This should provide the same speed and functionality associated with JDBC connection pooling.
 Moreover, all of OpenLink&#39;s Multi-Tier software provides database agent reuse rules.
 These rules can be set to emulate connection pooling.
