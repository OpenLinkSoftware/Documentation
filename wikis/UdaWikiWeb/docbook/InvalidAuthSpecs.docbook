<para>The actual SQLSTATE here is <computeroutput>28589</computeroutput>; the extra zero in the string is really an ASCII NULL.</para><para>The cause is as might be expected, an error in the username being used in the data connection.</para><para>Migrating from Progress SQL-89/4GL/ABL connections to SQL-92 connections may lead to this error, when the Progress database has no configured users (as would be found in the Progress <computeroutput>_User</computeroutput> table or in <computeroutput>sysprogress</computeroutput>).
 In this case, the solution is usually to use the name of the operating system user that created (or now owns) the database file, <computeroutput>databasename.lg</computeroutput>, with a blank password.</para><para> </para><bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h2"> Evidence </bridgehead>
