 It must be able to communicate over the network, and the binary must not be altered during or after installation.</para><para>In some environments, including recent versions of Mac OS X, the host OS may want to digitally &quot;sign&quot; the binary when confirming that it should be allowed to communicate over the network -- to get a pass through the software firewall.
 This signing process alters the license manager binary -- which then reports that it has been tampered with, ceases to evaluate licenses, and blocks all use of our licensed components.</para><para>If your copy of the License Manager binary has been signed or otherwise modified, you can reinstall to restore functionality.</para><para>If it has not been signed or otherwise modified, we may need to inspect the binary in its current state.
