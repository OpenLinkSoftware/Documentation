ODBC - call failed messages are common and generic.
 They do not reveal the true error condition.
 These errors are often preceded (and sometimes followed) by more informative errors.
 If you receive an &quot;ODBC - call failed&quot; error, take note of any errors which accompany it.
 Then, search the Knowledgebase for these errors.
