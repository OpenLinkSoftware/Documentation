=== Enable ODBC Connectivity with FileMaker 6.4 (Mac OS X) 
 
Problems can occur, if FileMaker 64 is installed on a partition and OpenLink's iODBC Driver Manager is installed on the boot disk. The following instructions will enable you to use FileMaker 6.4 successfully on a partition: 

1. Un-installed FileMaker, OpenLink's iODBC Driver Manager, and OpenLink's Driver. 

2. Re-install the OpenLink iODBC Driver Manager, OpenLink Driver, and FileMaker 6.0 on the boot drive. 

3. Create an OpenLink Data Source Name, and test it using the iODBC Data Sources Administrator and FileMaker 6.0. 
4. Move the FileMaker 6.0 installation to the target partition, once the DSN tests successfully. 

5. Retest the newly-relocated FileMaker 6.0 to ensure continued functionality. 

6. Use the FileMaker 6.4 upgrade package to upgrade the 6.0 installation tha resides on the target partition.
