* **Host ** — Hostname or IP address on which the OpenLink Request Broker resides. The OpenLink Request Broker is a Multi-Tier server component.  
* **Port ** — TCP port on which the OpenLink Request Broker listens.  
* **SVT ** — The value must match a [Domain Alias], which is contained in the Request Broker's Session Rules Book. This Alias typically represents the name and version of an OpenLink Agent. That agent version may differ from the DBMS version to which it connects. Note that advanced users may create custom domain names that follow their own, desired conventions.  
* **DATABASE ** — Target database name.  
* **OPTIONS ** — This field passes parameters that enable users to connect to MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, and Sybase databases anywhere on the network. It also passes parameters that enable users to connect to any DBMS that does not reside on the same machine as the OpenLink Request Broker and Agent.

* **UID ** — Database username.  
* **PWD ** — Database password.
