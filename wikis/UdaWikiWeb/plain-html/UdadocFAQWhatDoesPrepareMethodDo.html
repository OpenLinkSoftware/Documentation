 This setting can result in decreased performance when processing statements that do not contain parameters.</p><p>When set to Partial (-O 1) (the initial default), the driver creates stored procedures only if the statement contains parameters.
 Otherwise, the statement is cached and run directly at the time of SQLExecute.</p><p>When set to None (-O 0), stored procedures are never created.
 The driver caches the statement, executes it directly at the time of SQLExecute, and reports any syntax or similar errors at the time of SQLExecute.</p><p> <br></p><hr></div></body></html>
