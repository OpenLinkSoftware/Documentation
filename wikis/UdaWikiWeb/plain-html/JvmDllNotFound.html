<p>This error indicates that either the Java Virtual Machine (JVM, may be installed as part of the Java Development Kit [JDK] or Java Runtime Environment [JRE]) has not been installed, or the operating system cannot find it.</p><h2><a name="JVM (part of JRE or JDK) must be installed"></a> JVM (part of JRE or JDK) must be installed </h2>
<p>You must have a JVM that is compatible with our components</p><ul><li> Generally, the latest JVM from <a href="http://java.com/" class="absuri">http://java.com/</a> is the best choice.
<br></li>
<li> If using the 32-bit ODBC Driver, you <strong>must</strong> have the 32-bit JVM, even on 64-bit Windows.
<br></li>
<li> If using the 64-bit ODBC Driver, you <strong>must</strong> have the 64-bit JVM, which is automatically presented only to 64-bit IE but may be manually selected for download using any browser.
<br></li>
<li> It is generally best to <strong>install both 32-bit JVM and 64-bit JVM</strong> on 64-bit Windows.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="Directory containing jvm.dll must be in PATH"></a> Directory containing jvm.dll must be in PATH </h2>
<p>The path to the directory containing the <tt>jvm.dll</tt> must be included in your <tt>%PATH%</tt> Environment Variable.
 To do this, proceed as follows -- <br></p><ol><li> Use the Windows Explorer&#39;s <strong>Search</strong> feature to locate the <tt>jvm.dll</tt>, and make note of the directory in which it is found.
 If more than one is found, work with the most recent.
<br></li>
<li> <strong>Start</strong> -&gt; <strong>Control Panel</strong> -&gt; <strong>System</strong> <br></li>
<li> Click to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.
<br></li>
<li> Click the <strong>Environment Variables</strong> button.
<br></li>
<li> In the <strong>System variables</strong> pane, locate and select the environment variable named <strong><tt>PATH</tt></strong>.
<br></li>
<li> Click <strong>Edit</strong> which will bring up a new dialog containing <strong>Variable name</strong> and <strong>Variable value</strong> fields.
<br></li>
<li> Add the directory path from step #1 to the <strong>back end</strong> of the already present &quot;Variable value&quot; field, taking care not to delete anything that is already present.
 Directory paths are separated by a semi-colon &#39;;&#39;, so you should usually put a semicolon before the path you&#39;re adding.
 Typically, the text being added will resemble -- <br><br><pre><br>;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_03\bin\client
</pre><br></li>
<li> Finally, click <strong>OK</strong> to accept the changes.</li>
