 Virtuoso can readily access most of this via its virtual database.
 The Virtuoso SQL has a native XML data type which can be constructed from relational data using a number of SQL extensions.
 A mapping scheme mechanism allows presenting joins of tables as XML hierarchies.
 These &#39;virtual documents&#39; can be queried with XPATH which is translated to SQL to retrieve the relevant data and generate the XML rendition on demand.
<br></li>
<li> <strong>Storing XML data </strong> - A column of a table may be declared to hold XML.
 A special form of full text indexing is available for efficient retrieval of content with a special XPATH SQL predicate.
 While a mapping schema deals with rendering native relational data into XML as needed, this mechanism deals with retrieving native XML data in SQL.
<br></li>
<li> <strong>XQuery </strong> - Unified querying of structured and structured data - Virtuoso implements the emerging XQuery standard.
 This is a powerful language providing a single point of access to XML data whether it be stored natively as XML data, as relational data mapped to XML via a mapping schema or as XML on the external network.
<br>Whether XML data be stored or generated on the fly, Virtuoso provides a broad range of functions for processing it in SQL.
 These include all the SQLX functions for composing XML, an XSLT 1.2 processor for transforming documents, XPATH and XQuery and a DOM-like system.</li>
