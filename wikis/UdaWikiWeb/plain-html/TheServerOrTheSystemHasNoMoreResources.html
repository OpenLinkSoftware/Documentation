<p>These Progress/<nop></nop>OpenEdge-specific errors usually indicate that you have exceeded the maximum number of connections allocated for the database instance.</p><p>Sometimes the number of connections has been intentionally limited (typically because of a licensing or a design constraint).</p><p>Often, however, it is simply a misconfiguration of connection parameters, particularly including the <tt>-n</tt>, <tt>-Ma</tt>, and <tt>-Mn</tt> server startup parameters.
 Specific advice for these values differs with the version of your DBMS engine, your environment, etc.
 Please refer to your Progress documentation.</p><p>If the Progress/<nop></nop>OpenEdge instance is running on a Unix-like OS (e.g., AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris), it is possible that you have exceeded a kernel limit such as number of semaphores or swap space.
 These are often configurable (or &quot;tunable&quot;), with different specifics depending on your particular OS.
 Again, please refer to your Progress and/or OS documentation.</p></div></body></html>
