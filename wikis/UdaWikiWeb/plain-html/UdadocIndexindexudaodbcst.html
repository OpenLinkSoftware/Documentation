 Once installed, it provides connectivity to local or remote databases.</p><p>The OpenLink<a href="http://wikis.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/UdaWikiWeb/OpenLink&parent=UdadocIndexindexudaodbcst" class="wikiword">?</a>  Single-Tier is a client-only installation and goes some way to ensure the job for developers, administrators and end-users is simplified.
 Part of this is process means installing the software in one location as opposed to numerous locations.
 By discarding the server-side setup, there is no server-side administration so the user has only a single entry-point for installation and administration.
 In the majority of cases, knowing the database is all that is required.
 To the developer writing an application, there is no requirement to know on which server it resides: you can write your application for any environment, regardless of where it will end.
 There are also performance benefits gained by employing this single solution, which in some cases exceeds that provided by the native drivers.
 Being able to integrate your solution simply into your organization with its plethora of internal and disparate systems means your ROI increases significantly.</p><p>These drivers are built by implementing the ODBC data-access interface specifications using a database-vendor-provided Call Level Interface (CLI).
 Thus, the capabilities and architecture of the CLI significantly affect the functional outcome of a driver.</p><p> <br> [[/images/udaodbcst.gif|]]</p><p> <br>/ Image scaled down; Click to enlarge./</p><p> <br>ODBC (and any other data-access drivers for that matter) are developed using the call-level interface (CLI) of the respective databases that they support.
 These call level interfaces take the following forms:</p><ul><li>Type A - C-based dynamic SQL interface that inextricably includes client- and server-networking components <br></li>
<li>Type B - C-based remote procedure calls (RPC) interface to the wire-protocol of the underlying database.
 This is a client-only interface that communicates directly with the remote database server.
 These interfaces typically are unavailable to third-party developers.
