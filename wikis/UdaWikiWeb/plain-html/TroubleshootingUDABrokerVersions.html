<p>Request Broker Version Strings produce the following information:</p><ul><li> <strong>Version Information</strong> - Is the Broker current? Is the Broker version associated with specific limitations, formal bugzillas, or other known problems?</li>
</ul><ul><li> <strong>Platform of Compilation</strong> - Compare the platform of compilation information with the output of <code>uname -a</code> on the affected server.
 Is the Broker compatible with that operating system?</li>
</ul><p>Finally, version string errors provide useful, diagnostic information.
 Failure to produce version strings often stems from one of three problems:</p><ul><li> The Broker does not exist on the system.</li>
</ul><ul><li> Permissions prohibit the execution of the Broker version string.</li>
</ul><ul><li> The Broker has file dependency issues.
 You may need to adjust PATH or other environment variables to pick up needed libraries.</li>
</ul><p>Note: Request Broker Version Strings should be compared to Database Agent Version Strings and Client Version Strings to insure compatibility.
 Compatibility and stability problems arise, when Multi-Tier component versions differ.
