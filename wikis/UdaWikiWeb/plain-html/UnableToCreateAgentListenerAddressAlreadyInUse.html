<p>&quot;Unable to create agent listener&quot; errors are returned when all ports allocated for agent use (i.e., all ports between <tt>PortLow</tt> and <tt>PortHigh</tt>, as set in the active Rulebook) are in use by other processes (including other agent instances) when the Broker tries to launch a new Agent instance.</p><p>If you encounter such errors --</p><ol><li> Access the Multi-Tier server components installation.
<br></li>
<li> Use a text editor to open your active Rulebook (default, <tt>oplrqb.ini</tt>).
 You will generally find this file in the <tt>bin</tt> sub-directory of your <nop></nop>OpenLink server components installation.
<br></li>
<li> Locate the <tt>[Protocol TCP]</tt> section.
<br></li>
<li> Note the values set for <tt>PortLow</tt> and <tt>PortHigh</tt>.
 Ensure that this range is at least as large as the maximum number of agent instances you will have running simultaneously.
 We generally recommend allocating an additional 10-100 ports to this range, to allow unrelated processes to consume some ports as assigned by the OS.
<br></li>
<li> Save the Rulebook, restart the Broker, and monitor for recurrence of the error.</li>
