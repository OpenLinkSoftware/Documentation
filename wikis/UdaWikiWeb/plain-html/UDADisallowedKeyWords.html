<h3><a name="Disallowed Keywords"></a>Disallowed Keywords</h3>
<p>The following Keywords should not be added to the <nop></nop>ConnectOptions entry, as they are set by the Agent Configuration Setup dialog, or are applied automatically by the Request Broker:</p><ul><li> APP <br></li>
<li> DATABASE (see below) <br></li>
<li> DRIVER <br></li>
<li> DSN <br></li>
<li> FILEDSN <br></li>
<li> PWD <br></li>
<li> UID (see below)</li>
</ul><p>If any of the above Keywords are used, the agent will probably fail to log on to the Database server, as duplicate Connect Options may have been supplied.</p><p>Note: It is possible to add DATABASE<tt>=</tt> and UID<tt>=</tt> entries, provided that the Database:Name and Database:Username edit controls in the Agent Configuration dialog are left blank.
 Note the comments for the keyword, <nop></nop>TrustedConnection above, which affects the handling of the UID keyword.</p><p>The <nop></nop>OpenLink SQL2000 agent does not perform any consistency or validity checking on the <nop></nop>ConnectOptions entry, and passes the Connection options as entered to the SQL Server.
 If invalid keywords or values, or unreadable entries are supplied, the SQL Server may reject the login.</p><p>The exception is the case where the <nop></nop>ConnectOptions entry contains no recognizable entries, in which case it is assumed to be the value for the keyword, SERVER.
 A completely corrupted <nop></nop>ConnectOptions entry will therefore probably try to connect to an invalid server.
