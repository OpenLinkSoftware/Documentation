 As the Progress 4GL database engine allows the storage of character strings which are longer than the declared SQL width.
 For instance, creating a table with a char column will default to 8 but Progress will allow you to specify more than 8 characters.</p><p>When the values are returned without this option, only the first 8 characters will be returned.
 By specifying a Min value, the ODBC driver will override the value provided by the ODBC call SQLDescribecol and will use the value provided instead.</p><p>This is the more important of the two Field Size options and should always be specified first.
 For example, if your column as defined as char(8) but you have at least 255 characters, please specify a Min Field size of 255.</p><p> <br></p><hr></div></body></html>
