<nop></nop><p>OpenLink&#39;s relink scripts are associated with missing library errors and missing symbol errors.
 Use the following guidelines to troubleshoot these problems:</p><p><strong>Missing Libraries</strong></p><p>1.
 Search the machine for the missing library.</p><p>2.
 Insure that no file or directory permissions prohibit access to found libraries.</p><p>3.
 Insure that LD_ LIBRARY_PATH, LIBPATH, or SHLIB_PATH pass the location of found libraries.</p><p>4.
 Pass the full path to found libraries within the relink script itself.
 In most cases, pass the library on the cc -s -o line.
 However, pass the library on the make -f line in Oracle scripts.
 Pass the library under $PRO_EXTRA in Progress mkdlc scripts.</p><p><strong>Missing Symbols</strong></p><p>1.
 Login to the machine.</p><p>2.
 cd into the database&#39;s /lib sub-directory.</p><p>3.
 Run the following commands:</p><p>nm -A *.so | grep <em>symbol</em> - works for most Unix/Linux Operating Systems <br>nm -A *.sl | grep <em>symbol</em> - variant specific to HP/UX</p><p>For example:<br></p><pre>nm -A *.so | grep xsendto       
nm -A *.sl  | grep xsendto       
</pre><p> <br>4.
 Record the names of files, which contain the symbols.
 The filename will be the first name in the nm output.</p><p>5.
 cd to the /lib sub-directory of the <nop></nop>OpenLink installation.</p><p>6.
 vi the script that produced the error.</p><p>7.
 Pass the full path to found libraries within the relink script itself.
 In most cases, pass the library on the cc -s -o line.
 However, pass the library on the make -f line in Oracle scripts.
 Pass the library under $PRO_EXTRA in Progress mkdlc scripts.</p><p>Note: Relink script failures are serious problems.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink Product Support should create bugzillas when libraries or symbols cannot be found.
 In fact, <nop></nop>OpenLink Product Support may request .tars of your database native /lib files where possible to assist Support and Development in the recreation of the problem.
