<h3><a name="Session Rules Execution Process"></a>Session Rules Execution Process</h3>
<p>When an <nop></nop>OpenLink Client makes contact with an <nop></nop>OpenLink Request Broker a series of events occur culminating in the identification and execution of a session rule.
 The step as follow guide you through this process:</p><p>1.
 Request Broker receives session request from one or more <nop></nop>OpenLink Clients (Drivers for ODBC, UDBC, JDBC, OLE-DB).</p><p>2.
 Request Broker parses the session request data stream received from the relevant <nop></nop>OpenLink Client isolating each <nop></nop>OpenLink Connection Attribute type and associated attribute values.</p><p>3.
 Request Broker then performs a regular expression search through the rule book looking for Session Aliases that match the parsed <nop></nop>OpenLink Connection Attributes.</p><p>4.
 For each <nop></nop>OpenLink Connection Attribute that the Request Broker find a matching Session Alias it determines if the Alias has a non NULL assigned value, if this is true the <nop></nop>OpenLink Connection Attribute values are reassigned to those of the matching Session Alias, otherwise they retain their existing values.</p><p>5.
 Request Broker then performs a regular expression search using a combination of all the <nop></nop>OpenLink Connection Attributes across the session rules books &quot;Mapping Rules&quot; template.</p><p>6.
 The Request Broker scans through each &quot;Mapping Rule&quot; in ascending order, If it finds a &quot;Mapping Rule&quot; match it then applies the matching rule to the appropriate Client Session request, otherwise it reports an error condition back to the <nop></nop>OpenLink client.</p><p>7.
 When a &quot;Mapping Rules&quot; occurs the Request Broker evaluates the &quot;Mapping Rule&quot;.
 This evaluation results in the Acceptance or Rejection of an <nop></nop>OpenLink Client request.</p><p>8.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink Client request acceptance results in the <nop></nop>OpenLink Clients session request being associated with an <nop></nop>OpenLink Agent template, this template then applies all of its attribute Attributes to the <nop></nop>OpenLink Agent Configuration process.</p><p>9.
 Session Rules rejection results in a user/administrator definable error message being relayed back to the <nop></nop>OpenLink Client.</p><p>10.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink Session is fully initialized.
 This means that the <nop></nop>OpenLink Client and Server (agents) components are now linked and operating in a connected state.</p><p>11.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink Agent evaluates subsequent <nop></nop>OpenLink Client session requests to see if they are in line with the <nop></nop>ReUse attribute of its Agent Configuration template.
