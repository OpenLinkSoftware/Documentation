<p>In order to make use of this functionality, you need to create a certificate on the server running the request broker.
 On Unix platforms we have provided a bin/mkcert.sh script as part of the installation.
 On other platforms you may have to run openssl by hand or use another system to generate the PEM file (such as generating it on a unix server and copying the files across).</p><p>A sample run of the mkcert.sh script, showing the various questions it asks to identify your organization, follows:<br></p><pre>bash$ cd /usr/openlink/bin/
bash$ ./mkcert.sh mykey

writing new private key to &#39;mykey.key&#39;
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter &#39;.&#39;, the field will be left blank.

</pre><p> <br>Having created the key-pair, you now need to tell the request broker to use them.
 This requires the following lines to be present in the rulebook (oplrqb.ini):<br></p><pre>[Request Broker]
....
SSLKeyFile = mykey.pem
SSLRequired = No            
</pre><p> <br>The <nop></nop>SSLKeyFile is the filename of the key you just created; to deny connections without SSL, set SSLRequired</p><p>Yes instead.</p><p>You can also put these options in the individual database agent sections, such that one key is used for e.g.
 Ingres, and another for SQL Server, or one for your sales database and another for people coming in from VPN IP#s (by editing the mapping rules to match on a per-IP# basis).
 For example:<br></p><pre>[generic_sqlserver]
.....
SSLKeyFile = mykey-sqlserver.pem
SSLRequired = Yes                  ; All SQLServer connections
MUST use SSL
</pre><p> <br>As an alternative to editing oplrqb.ini by hand, you can use the web-based Administrator GUI, either the form or wizards, to set the SSL Key File and SSL Required fields, thus:</p><p>Figure: 1.
