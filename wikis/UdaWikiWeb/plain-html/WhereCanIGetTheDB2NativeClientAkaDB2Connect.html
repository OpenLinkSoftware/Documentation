<nop></nop><p>OpenLink Software does not supply the DB2 native client.
 Instead, the DB2 native client should ship with the standard DB2 DBMS install media.
 At the time of writing, staff notes that the DB2 native client appears on a  CD explicitly labeled &quot;Connect.&quot; However, packaging and marketing labels are subject to change.</p><p>If you do not have the DB2 client install CD, you should visit the IBM Software Mall to see if the appropriate DB2 client version is available for download.
