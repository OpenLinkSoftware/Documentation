<p>The following instructions will enable you to provide greater security for your database:</p><ol><li> List all Domain aliases (aka &quot;<nop></nop>ServerTypes&quot;) used in your client-side DSNs.
 For example: <br><br><pre><br>Oracle 8.0.x
</pre><br></li>
<li> Use a text editor to open the <tt>oplrqb.ini</tt> file which resides in the <tt>/bin</tt> sub-directory of your <nop></nop>OpenLink server components installation.
<br></li>
<li> Locate <tt>[Domain Aliases]</tt> and determine how those listed above are resolved.
 For example: <br><br><pre><br>[Domain Aliases]
Oracle 8.0.x = ora80
</pre><br></li>
<li> Locate the resolved names of the Domain Aliases under <tt>[Mapping Rules]</tt>.
 For instance: <br><br><pre><br>[Mapping Rules]
ora80:*:*:*:*:*:* = accept generic_ora80. 
</pre><br></li>
<li> Determine whether any of these fields need added security.
 Here is a breakdown: <br><br><pre><br>domain_name:database:user:client_os:machine_id:app_name:operation_mode
</pre><br>(<strong>Note:</strong> &quot;operation_mode&quot; refers to read-only (ro) or read-and-write (rw) access.) <br></li>
<li> Build rules to govern whether connection requests will be accepted or rejected by the Broker.
 For instance: <br><br><pre><br>ora80:*:scott:*:*:*:* = reject User &quot;scott&quot; is not allowed to connect to this service.
</pre><br>This rule rejects all connection attempts made by user scott, and tells them so.
 You can substitute any plain-text rejection message here, and it will be delivered to users who are blocked by this rule.
<br></li>
<li> Order each rule properly.
 For example: <br><br><pre><br>ora80:*:*:*:*:*:* = accept generic_ora80                     
ora80:*:*:*:*:msaccess:* = reject Microsoft Access is not allowed to connect to this service.        
</pre><br>The first rule permits access to generic_ora80 in all scenarios.
 The second rule is never visited, since the preceding rule permits all ora80 requests.
<br><br><pre><br>ora80:*:*:*:*:msaccess:* = reject Microsoft Access is not allowed to connect to this service.
ora80:*:*:*:*:*:* = accept generic_ora80                     
</pre><br>The first rule screens for and rejects connections requested by Microsoft Access.
 Connections not originating with Microsoft Access are passed on to the second rule, which permits all requests.
<br></li>
<li> Save your changes and exit the file.
<br></li>
<li> Restart your Broker.
