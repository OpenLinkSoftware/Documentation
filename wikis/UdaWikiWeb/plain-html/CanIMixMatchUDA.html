<nop></nop><p>OpenLink Software does not support mixed-version installations.
 Mismatched client and server software may not hinder your ability to connect and query.
 However, version incompatibility issues will arise over time.
 In fact, if you mix <nop></nop>OpenLink 3.x and <nop></nop>OpenLink 4.x software, you can expect specific problems with stability, transactions, and threading.
 These problems may only be resolved by upgrading the older component.</p><p> <br><font color="#ff0000">Be advised:</font> Under rare circumstances, you may be forced to deploy a mixed installation.
 As stated previously, 3.x and 4.x components tend to generate problems.
 However, 4.x client components appear to work well with 5.x server components.
