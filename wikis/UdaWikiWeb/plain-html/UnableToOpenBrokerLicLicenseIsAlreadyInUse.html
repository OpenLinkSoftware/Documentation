<p>This error has two common causes.</p><h2><a name="1 - License Manager does not have sufficient access to TCP/IP network communications"></a> 1 - License Manager does not have sufficient access to TCP/IP network communications </h2>
<p>Resolution typically requires <a href="http://wikis.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/UdaWikiWeb/OplmgrNetworking" class="wikiword">opening a few ports in the License Manager host&#39;s firewall</a>.</p><h2><a name="2 - Multiple hosts have the same serialized license file"></a> 2 - Multiple hosts have the same serialized license file </h2>
<p>Resolution simply requires that each licensed host have a uniquely serialized license file -- that is, that each serial number is found on only one host.
 After you&#39;ve confirmed license file uniqueness, restart all <nop></nop>OpenLink-related processes, most importantly the License Manager, and this error should cease.
