<p> <br>C++ Demo is a test application, which ships with <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s <nop></nop>WinNT drivers.
 C++ Demo is used to perform basic connection tests and queries.
 In fact, if you encounter persistent connection or SQL errors with <nop></nop>OpenLink drivers, you want to repeat your tests with C++ Demo.
 Moreover, <nop></nop>OpenLink suggests that you create traces or log files with C++ Demo, when appropriate.
 Use of this program helps Support staff isolate drivers or applications as the source of some problems.
