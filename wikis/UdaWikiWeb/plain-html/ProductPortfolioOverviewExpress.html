<nop></nop><p>OpenLink&#39;s Express Edition drivers are similar to <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Single-Tier drivers.
 They require a single installation on the machine that hosts the client application.
 Whereas Single-Tier drivers establish connectivity via the database native client or use of the database wire protocol, Express Edition drivers establish connectivity through use of 3rd-party, native JDBC drivers that pre-exist on the client machine.</p><p>Express Edition drivers are lightweight, low cost drivers that are suitable for environments wherein performance is not a critical issue.
 Likewise, Express Edition drivers should not be advanced when there is a need for exceptional stability or security.
 Single-Tier drivers provide better performance, and Multi-Tier drivers provide the most reliable stability and advanced security features.
