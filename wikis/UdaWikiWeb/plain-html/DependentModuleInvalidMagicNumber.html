 The module has an invalid magic number.

<p>&quot;Invalid magic number&quot; errors indicate a &quot;bitness&quot; mismatch -- a 32-bit application trying to load a 64-bit library, or a 64-bit application trying to load a 32-bit library.</p><p>On Mac OS X and most Unix-like OS, you can check the bitness of any file with a simple command -- <br><br></p><pre>file /path/to/file
</pre><p> <br>On 64-bit Windows, 32-bit components are generally installed within the <tt>Programs (x86)</tt> or (counterintuitively) the <tt>SysWow64</tt> directories.
 64-bit components are generally installed within the <tt>Programs</tt> or (counterintuitively) the <tt>System32</tt> directories.</p><p>On a client host (whether Single-Tier or Multi-Tier), the bitness of the client application (e.g., HSODBC, DG4ODBC, Crystal Reports, Microsoft Excel) forces the bitness of the data access driver and/or driver manager.
 On Single-Tier client hosts, the bitness of the client application also mandates the bitness of the DBMS client libraries (e.g., <tt>libesql92.so</tt>, <tt>libifsql.so</tt>).</p><p>On a Multi-Tier Broker host, the bitness of the DBMS client libraries (e.g., <tt>libesql92.so</tt>, <tt>libifsql.so</tt>) forces the bitness of the Request Broker and Database Agent.</p><p>If you have both 32-bit and 64-bit components present, this error can be resolved by ensuring that all executable and shared library path (e.g., <tt>PATH</tt>, <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>, <tt>SHLIB_PATH</tt>, <tt>LIBPATH</tt>) variables are set to target components of the same bitness.</p><p>If you do not have both 32-bit and 64-bit components present, determine the bitness of the &quot;controlling&quot; components, and acquire and/or install the other components to match.
