<p>64-bit software components cannot be used on 32-bit hardware, and generally cannot be used on 32-bit operating systems.</p><p>Some apparently-32-bit operating systems actually have limited support for 64-bit components.
 This is true of Mac OS X 10.4.x (Tiger) on <nop></nop>PowerPC G5 hardware, and Mac OS X 10.4.x (Tiger) and 10.5.x (Leopard) on Intel hardware.
 In these environments, command-line (non-GUI) components may be 64-bit.
 Such deployments are fairly rare, but our components are supported for such use.
 (It is recommended that such deployments be upgraded to Mac OS X 10.6.x (Snow Leopard) or later, on Intel Core 2 Duo or later hardware, which environments deliver full 64-bit support in the GUI as well as the command-line.) <br></p></div></body></html>
