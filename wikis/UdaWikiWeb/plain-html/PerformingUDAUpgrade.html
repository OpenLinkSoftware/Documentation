 The first option should overwrite older drivers.
 DSNs that use those drivers will be affected.
 They should be migrated to the new driver.
 However, to insure the integrity of existing DSNs, choose the second option.
 This option installs the new driver alongside the old driver.
 Pre-existing DSNs should not be affected in any way.</font> <br></p></div></body></html>
