<p>There are two scenarios in which you would require the Informix native client.
 You must install the Informix client on the same machine as any Informix Single-Tier driver.
 Additionally, you must install the Informix client on the same machine as <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Multi-Tier Request Broker and Informix Database Agent, if the Broker and Informix Agent do not reside on the same machine as the Informix database.
