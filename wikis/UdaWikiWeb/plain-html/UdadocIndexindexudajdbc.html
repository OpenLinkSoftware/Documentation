 As with Java itself one of the main features of the JDBC API is its &quot;Write Once, Run Anywhere&quot; capability enabling applications to be move from one OS to another without the need for recompilation.
 JDBC consists of two key components:</p><ul><li> <strong>JDBC Driver Manager </strong> - application binds to this generic class which is then responsible for loading the requested JDBC Driver.
<br></li>
<li> <strong>JDBC Driver </strong> - dynamically loaded by the JDBC Driver manager for making connection to target Database.
<br>JDBC Drivers are available in four different types ranging from Pure to Bridge construction:</li>
</ul><ul><li> <strong>Type 4 </strong> - Direct-to-Database Pure Java Driver using database network protocol for driver communication with database from Java <br></li>
<li> <strong>Type 3 </strong> - Pure Java Driver for Database Middleware using a middleware vendor&#39;&#39;s protocol-layer for connectivity to the Database.
<br></li>
<li> <strong>Type 2 </strong> - A native API partly Java technology-enabled driver converting JDBC calls into the Database vendor&#39;&#39;s CLI calls for communication with the database.
<br></li>
<li> <strong>Type 1 </strong> - JDBC-ODBC Bridge using an existing ODBC Driver for connecting to remote databases.
<br>JDBC enables maximum interoperability between the application and database as a single application can access any JDBC-enabled database by simply being configured to use its JDBC driver, and likewise a JDBC enabled application can access a given Database using its JDBC driver.
 JDBC also has the added advantage of being able to run cross platform with the need for recompilation, the so-called &quot;Write Once, Run Anywhere&quot; capability.</li>
