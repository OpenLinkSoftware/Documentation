<p>Prophet 21 ships as an AIX server, which contains a Progress database and our Multi-Tier server components.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> For several years, Prophet 21 has included a deprecated version (typically Release 3.x or 4.x) of the Multi-Tier server components.
 We strongly recommend upgrading these to the <a href="http://uda.openlinksw.com/odbc-progress-mt/" class="absuri">latest available version</a> (Release 5.x or later) for the Progress engine in your Prophet 21 installation.
 If you choose to upgrade, the rest of this page may be ignored; our general instructions are sufficient.</em></p><p>It is important that the Release version of the Multi-Tier Generic Client (ODBC, JDBC, or ADO.NET) components on your client host match the Release version of the Multi-Tier server-side components as closely as possible.
 Using Clients from one major Release (e.g., 5.x) against Broker/Agent from another major Release (e.g., 3.x) is neither tested, recommended, nor supported.
 We have made major changes in data type handling, among other things, which may lead to unpredictable and undesirable results when using such mixes of component versions.</p><p> <br></p><h2><a name="Determine the version of the existing Multi-Tier components"></a> Determine the version of the existing Multi-Tier components </h2>
<ol><li> Access your AIX server&#39;s command line.

<li> Run these commands: <br><br><pre><br>cd /usr/lpp/p21pro/openlink         [ENTER]
./oplrqb -?                         [ENTER]

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Some client operating systems (e.g., Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, all 64-bit Windows) are not and will not be supported by the deprecated Release 3.x and 4.x Multi-Tier Clients matching the server components typically pre-installed on Prophet 21 machines.
 If your client operating system is among these, you must upgrade the server components to the <a href="http://uda.openlinksw.com/odbc-progress-mt/" class="absuri">latest available version</a> for the Progress engine in your Prophet 21 installation.
