 Ensure that there is enough space on C: for temporary use by the installer.
 Generally, at least 100MB is recommended.</p><p>2.
 Clean out the temp directories on C:, especially:<br></p><pre> C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\Local Settings\Temp\
 C:\Temp
</pre><p> <br>3.
 Stop Outlook and Outlook Express, in addition to all other programs not required to be running (freeing up as much memory as possible is recommended).</p><p>If all the above fails to resolve the problem, it&#39;s possible the machine has a corrupt installer core, or some other machine-specific problem has arisen.
