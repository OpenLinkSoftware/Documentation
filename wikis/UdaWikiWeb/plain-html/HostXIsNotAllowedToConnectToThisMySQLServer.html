<p>When clients try to connect to <nop></nop>MySQL, the server checks username and password <i>and</i> the originating host value against its permissions tables.</p><p>This error typically indicates that this username has not been granted appropriate permissions when connecting from this host.</p><p>You can fix this by using the command-line <tt>mysql</tt> tool (on the server host!) to GRANT permissions for the user/hostname combination from which you are trying to connect, and then executing <tt>mysqladmin flush-privileges</tt>.
  See <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/grant.html#grant-accounts-passwords" class="absuri">this section of MySQL documentation</a> for more details.</p><p>If you are running <nop></nop>MySQL Version 3.23 or later and you don&#39;t know the IP address and/or hostname of the machine from which you are connecting, you can put a wildcard entry with &#39;<tt>%</tt>&#39; as the <tt>Host</tt> column value in the user table and restart <tt>mysqld</tt> with the <tt>--log</tt> option on the server machine.
 After trying to connect from the client machine, the information in the <nop></nop>MySQL log will indicate the client host&#39;s IP address and/or hostname.
 <i><b>Important:</b> you should then replace the &#39;<tt>%</tt>&#39; in the user table entry with the actual hostname that shows up in the log.
 Otherwise, you&#39;ll have a system that is insecure.</i></p><p>A rare cause of this error on Linux is a <nop></nop>MySQL binary that was compiled with a newer <tt>glibc</tt> version than is found on the current binary host.
 In this case, you should either upgrade your OS/glibc or download the source <nop></nop>MySQL version and compile this yourself.
 A source RPM is normally trivial to compile and install, so this shouldn&#39;t be a big problem.</p><p> <br></p></div></body></html>
