<p>There are two types of Multi-Tier Connection Attributes: &quot;User-Configurable&quot; and &quot;Non-User-Configurable&quot;.</p><h2><a name="User-Configurable Connection Attributes"></a>User-Configurable Connection Attributes</h2>
<p>User-Configurable attributes are set in various ways, depending on the connection mechanism.</p><ul><li> ODBC: in the ODBC DSN, typically through the ODBC Administrator, or the ODBC Connect String <br></li>
<li> JDBC: in the JDBC URL, or, with JDBC 2.0 or later, the JDBC DSN <br></li>
<li> ADO.NET: in the Connection String</li>
</ul><p><strong>Domain Attribute</strong> <br>Identifies the Multi-Tier Agent to which all the Multi-Tier Connection Attributes will apply.</p><p>This attribute describes a logical reference for a database type, Multi-Tier agent type, or anything else you would like to use as a logical identifier for all the other Multi-Tier Connection Attributes.</p><p>This attribute is also referred to as the &quot;Server Type&quot; or &quot;SVT&quot; attribute of a Multi-Tier Generic Client connect string.
 It is also referred to in older product documentation as the Multi-Tier &quot;Provider Type&quot;.</p><p><strong>User Attribute</strong> <br>Identifies the User making use of a Multi-Tier Generic Client.</p><p><strong>Database Attribute</strong> <br>Identifies a specific database name (a/k/a &quot;schema&quot; or &quot;catalog&quot;) within a database environment (e.g., <tt>ORCL</tt> for Oracle, <tt>stores7</tt> for Informix, <tt>pubs</tt> with Sybase or Microsoft SQL Server, <tt>iSports</tt> for Progress).
 The values associated with this Connection Attribute aren&#39;t overridden by Aliases; however, they may be overridden by the &quot;Database&quot; attribute within an Agent Configuration template.</p><p><strong><nop></nop>ServerOpts (Database Server Environment Options) Attribute</strong> <br>Identifies a set of database environment initialization parameters, currently this attribute only applies to Progress environments.
 It is used to set self-serving client initialization parameters such as: <tt>-TB</tt>, <tt>-TB</tt>, <tt>-q</tt>, <tt>-D mdy</tt>, etc.
 The values associated with this Connection Attribute aren&#39;t overridden by Aliases; instead, they are overridden by the <tt>ServerOptions</tt> attribute within an Agent Configuration template.</p><p><strong><nop></nop>ConnectOpts (Database Server Connection Options) Attribute</strong> <br>Identifies a set of database server connection parameters used to initiate a connection with a backend database server process.
 This is how a Multi-Tier Database Agent makes a connection with a back-end database server using a particular database vendors networking middleware (e.g., Net8 or SQL*Net for Oracle, I-Connect or I-Net for Informix, Progress Client Networking for Progress, Open Client for Sybase).
 The values associated with this Connection Attribute aren&#39;t overridden by Aliases, instead they are overridden by the <tt>ConnectOptions</tt> attribute within an Agent Configuration template.</p><h2><a name="Non-User-Configurable Connection Attributes"></a> Non-User-Configurable Connection Attributes</h2>
<p>These attributes are environmental in nature, and are derived automatically by a Multi-Tier Generic Client.</p><p><strong><nop></nop>OpSys (Operating System) attribute</strong> <br>Identifies the Client operating system from which the Multi-Tier Generic Client is being executed.
<br>Machine attribute</p><p><strong>Host attribute</strong> <br>Identifies the Network Alias or IP address of the machine or device from the Multi-Tier Client is being executed.</p><p><strong>Application attribute</strong> <br>Identifies the Client Application from which the connection originates.<i><b>Note:</b> The Application name can be set by an application using an ODBC API call, <tt>SQLSetConnectOption(hdbc, SQL_APPLICATION_NAME, &quot;AppName&quot;)</tt>.
 The JDBC equivalent can also be used.</i></p>
<p><strong>Mode attribute</strong> <br>Identifies the session Mode required by an Multi-Tier Client, this may be Read-Only or Read-Write.</p><p> <br></p></div></body></html>
