<p>You may receive this message when issuing long SQL statements to a Progress instance.</p><p>The <code>-inp</code> parameter is a Progress startup parameter, and must usually be set when the Progress server is started, typically through the &quot;<code>startup.pf</code>&quot; file, which is itself typically (but not always) found in the <code>$DLC</code> directory.
 The active file may also be specified by the <code>$PROSTARTUP</code> environment variable.</p><p>When <code>-inp</code> is increased, you generally must also increase <code>-tok</code>, and the latter is generally recommended to be set to its maximum.
 For example, the following lines would be added to your <code>startup.pf</code> â€” <br><br></p><pre>-inp 8192     # max value is 32000
-tok 1600     # max value is  1600
</pre><p>The Progress server(s) must be restarted after making this change.
