<p>The &quot;database already connected error&quot; suggests that you have tried to connect to the same database twice.
 However, you have not terminated the first connection to that database.
 Alternatively, your application may have issued a disconnect for the first connection.
 However, that disconnect may have been deferred.</p><p>To resolve this issue, I need additional resources.
 First, please supply an <nop></nop>OpenLink Session Rules Book.
 I need to insure that your database agent <nop></nop>ReUse is Never.
 I must also determine whether or not tableview is enforced.
 Use of both Tableview and <tt>ReUse=Never</tt> have resolved this problem, in the past.
 Additionally, please send a clientside ODBC trace.
 The trace may reveal additional factors contributing to this matter.</p><p> <br></p></div></body></html>
