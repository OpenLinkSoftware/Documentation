<ul><li> Your target data source must be SQL compliant.
<br></li>
<li> You must have all information necessary to configure a JDBC connection to the data source.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="Software Requirements"></a> Software Requirements </h2>
<ul><li> You must possess <strong>third-party or native JDBC drivers</strong> that connect to your target data source.
 A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as the Multi-Tier &quot;Enterprise&quot; Edition Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources.
<br></li>
<li> The JDBC driver jar file (or a symbolic link to it) must be included in the active <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>.
<br><ul><li> Supporting Java libraries (or links to them) may also need to be included in this variable value.
<br></li>
<li> Directories containing other supporting libraries may need to be included in one of the other shared library environment variables (e.g., <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>, <tt>LIBPATH</tt>, <tt>SHLIB_PATH</tt>).
<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li> You must have a <strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</strong> that is compatible with the Multi-Tier &quot;Enterprise&quot; Edition Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources.
<br><ul><li> Generally, the latest JVM from <a href="http://java.com/" class="absuri">http://java.com/</a> is the best choice.
<br></li>
<li> If using a 64-bit JDBC Driver, you must have a 64-bit JVM, and 64-bit Multi-Tier &quot;Enterprise&quot; Edition Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><h2><a name="Configuration Requirements"></a> Configuration Requirements </h2>
<ul><li> The Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources must be installed on the same machine as the JDBC drivers that connect to the target database.
<br></li>
<li> You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are already in use on the Broker host.
 These ports are the defaults used by our Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant.
 If other services are using these, you will need to assign different (unused) ports to the new services during installation.
<br></li>
<li> For best results, the Multi-Tier server components should be installed while logged in as the owner of the local third-party JDBC driver.
<br></li>
<li> All JDBC-related environment variables should be set prior to installation.
 This is typically accomplished simply by logging in as the owner of the local third-party JDBC driver, but if logged in as a different user, you can often achieve the same by using that user&#39;s <code>.profile</code> or similar, with a command like one of these (depending on your active shell) -- <br><br><pre><br>source ./.profile
. ./.profile
</pre><br></li>
<li> You must know the driver class name of your JDBC driver.
<br></li>
<li> You must know the full details of the JDBC connection URL that connects to your target JDBC Data Source.</li>
