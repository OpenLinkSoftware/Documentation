<ul><li> Your target data source must be SQL compliant.
<br></li>
<li> You must have all information necessary to configure a JDBC connection to the data source.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="Software Requirements"></a> Software Requirements </h2>
<ul><li> You must possess <strong>third-party or native JDBC drivers</strong> that connect to your target data source.
 A client portion of these drivers must be installed on the same machine as the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources.
<br></li>
<li> Your Windows environment must be configured to enable connections using the intended JDBC driver.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink Product Support can provide minimal assistance in this area.
<br><ul><li> Particularly, the full path to the JDBC driver <tt>.jar</tt> file must be included in your <tt>%CLASSPATH%</tt> Environment Variable.
 To do this, proceed as follows -- <br><ol><li> Locate the JDBC DRiver <tt>.jar</tt> file, and make note of the the full path to that file.
<br></li>
<li> <strong>Start</strong> -&gt; <strong>Control Panel</strong> -&gt; <strong>System</strong> <br></li>
<li> Click to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.
<br></li>
<li> Click the <strong>Environment Variables</strong> button.
<br></li>
<li> In the &quot;System variables&quot; pane, locate and select the environment variable named &quot;CLASSPATH&quot; . <br></li>
<li> Click <strong>Edit</strong> which will bring up a new dialog containing <strong>Variable name</strong> and <strong>Variable value</strong> fields.
<br></li>
<li> Add the full file path from step #1 to the <strong>start</strong> of the already present &quot;Variable value&quot; field, taking care not to delete anything that is already present.
 Directory paths are separated by a semi-colon &#39;;&#39;, so you should usually put a semicolon after the path you&#39;re adding.
 Typically, the new text will resemble -- <br><br><pre><br>C:\Program Files\JDBC for DBMS\lib\driver.jar;
</pre><br></li>
<li> Finally, click <strong>OK</strong> to accept the changes.
<br></li>
</ol></li>
<li> Supporting Java libraries (or links to them) may also need to be included in this variable value.
<br></li>
<li> Directories containing other supporting libraries may need to be included in one of the other shared library environment variables (e.g., <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>, <tt>LIBPATH</tt>, <tt>SHLIB_PATH</tt>).
<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li> If using a 64-bit JDBC Driver, you must have the 64-bit Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources.
<br></li>
<li> You must have a <strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</strong> that is compatible with the Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) Request Broker and Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources.
<br><ul><li> Generally, the latest JVM from <a href="http://java.com/" class="absuri">http://java.com/</a> is the best choice.
<br></li>
<li> If using a 64-bit JDBC Driver, you must have a 64-bit JVM, which is only presented to 64-bit IE.
<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li> The path to the directory containing the <tt>jvm.dll</tt> must be included in your <tt>%PATH%</tt> Environment Variable.
 To do this, proceed as follows -- <br><ol><li> Use the Windows Explorer&#39;s <strong>Search</strong> feature to locate the <tt>jvm.dll</tt>, and make note of the directory in which it is found.
 If more than one is found, work with the most recent.
<br></li>
<li> <strong>Start</strong> -&gt; <strong>Control Panel</strong> -&gt; <strong>System</strong> <br></li>
<li> Click to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.
<br></li>
<li> Click the <strong>Environment Variables</strong> button.
<br></li>
<li> In the &quot;System variables&quot; pane, locate and select the environment variable named &quot;PATH&quot; . <br></li>
<li> Click <strong>Edit</strong> which will bring up a new dialog containing <strong>Variable name</strong> and <strong>Variable value</strong> fields.
<br></li>
<li> Add the directory path from step #1 to the <strong>end</strong> of the already present &quot;Variable value&quot; field, taking care not to delete anything that is already present.
 Directory paths are separated by a semi-colon &#39;;&#39;, so you should usually put a semicolon before the path you&#39;re adding.
 Typically, the new text will resemble -- <br><br><pre><br>;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_03\bin\client
</pre><br></li>
<li> Finally, click <strong>OK</strong> to accept the changes.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul><h2><a name="Configuration Requirements"></a> Configuration Requirements </h2>
<ul><li> The Bridge Agent(s) for JDBC Data Sources must be installed on the same machine as the JDBC drivers that connect to the target database.
<br></li>
<li> You must know whether TCP ports 5000 and 8000 are already in use on the Broker host.
 These ports are the defaults used by our Request Broker and Web-based Admin Assistant.
 If other services are using these, you will need to assign different (unused) ports to the new services during installation.
<br></li>
<li> For best results, the Enterprise Edition server components should be installed while logged in as the owner of the local third-party JDBC driver.
<br></li>
<li> All JDBC-related environment variables should be set prior to installation.
 This is typically accomplished simply by logging in as the owner of the local third-party JDBC driver.
<br></li>
<li> You must know the driver class name of your JDBC driver.
<br></li>
<li> You must know the full details of the JDBC connection URL that connects to your target JDBC Data Source.</li>
