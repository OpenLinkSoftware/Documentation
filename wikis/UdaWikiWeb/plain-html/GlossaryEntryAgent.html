<p>Agent is shorthand for database agent.
 A database Agent is the only database-specific component in <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Multi-Tier architecture.
 In fact, these agents are built against a database&#39;s CLI.
 When the <nop></nop>OpenLink Request Broker receives a connection request, it spawns the appropriate agent.
 Then, the agent retrieves data from the database and returns it to the calling client.</p><p>Note: Agents connect directly to the database in a standard Two-Tier or &quot;Client/Server&quot; configuration.
 However, most agents connect to the database via the database native libraries in a Three-Tier or &quot;Application Server&quot; configuration.
 MS <nop>SQLServer, <nop></nop>MySQL, and <nop></nop>PostgreSQL agents are the exception.
 They connect directly to the database in both Client/Server and Application Server configurations.
