<p>The Mac OS SDK package ships as a compressed Macintosh format (.sit, .hqx).
 After uncompressing it on your hard drive, you will find the following iODBC SDK directory structure or tree installed on Mac OS Classic :</p><p>Figure: 1.

 Each one has its proper set of include files and libraries:</p><ul><li> The iODBC Driver Manager - Its main task is to load the right ODBC driver and run functions appropriate to that driver.</li>
</ul><ul><li> The iODBC Configuration Manager - Its main task is to access and manage the DSN configuration files.</li>
</ul><ul><li> The iODBC GUI Manager - Its main task is to give to the user the ability to access all ODBC functionality through a GUI.</li>
</ul><p>Under the include directory, you will find all the iODBC header files that can be used in your source.
 The main header files are: isql.h, isqlext.h, isqltypes.h, iodbcadm.h, iodbcinst.h</p><p>The aformentioned files generally serve as proxies for other header files provided in the same directory: sql.h, sqlext.h, sqltypes.h, odbcinst.h</p><p>To access all these include files, simply add to your compiler an include path that points to iODBC/include.
 This is compiler dependent, so you may have to look into your compiler&#39;s documentation.
 For Code Warrior, you can do this via the Project Preferences panel.</p><p>Under the lib directory, you will find all the iODBC libraries needed to link against your application.
 All of the above mentioned components are shipped in three different forms: CFM shared library, static object file, and static object file with debugging information.</p><p>Figure: 2.
 iODBC SDK libraries on Mac <br> <br><img src="MacClassiciODBC/MacTree2.png" style="wikiautogen"></p>
<p>You have to link your application with only one set of libraries.
 If you choose the CFM shared library set, ensure that at runtime these files are in the System-Extensions folder of your Mac Classic system.</p><p>To access the right set of library files, add a library path that points to iODBC/lib.
 This is compiler dependent.
 Consult your compiler documentation.
