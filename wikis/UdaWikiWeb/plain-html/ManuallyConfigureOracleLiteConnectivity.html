<ol><li> Edit the <tt>$OPENLINKINI</tt> file, e.g., <tt>/opt/openlink/bin/openlink.ini</tt>, and make sure the environment section for the driver contains the right entries.
 It should look something like this: <br><br><pre><br>[Environment Oracle 10.x]
ORACLE_HOME            = /dbs/oracle10g/oracle/product/10.1.0/client_1
;ORACLE_SERVER          = T
;TWO_TASK               = P:
;ODBC_CATALOGS          = Y                      ; Uncomment after loading odbccat10.sql
;MULTIPLEX_LDA          = 5                      ; Allow 5 OpenLink clients on a single lda
;OPL_USR_TBLS_FIRST     = Y                      ; Sort SQLTables starting with user tables
SHOW_REMARKS           = N                      ; Retrieve SQLColumns REMARKS field
CURSOR_SENSITIVITY     = LOW                    ; Set to HIGH after loading odbccat10.sql
;OCI_PREFETCH_ROWS      = 100                    ; Number of rows to prefetch
;OCI_PREFETCH_MEMORY    = 65535                  ; Amount of memory to use for prefetching
;NLS_LANG               = AMERICAN_AMERICA.UTF8  ; Set to codepage required by client application
ORACLE_SID             = ORCL
</pre><br>These environment variable values are database specific and are described in detail later in this section.
<br></li>
<li> Edit the <tt>$ODBCINI</tt> file, e.g., <tt>/opt/openlink/bin/odbc.ini</tt>, and adjust the settings of the sample DSN that is found there: <br><br><pre><br>[ora100_lite]
Driver          = /opt/openlink/lib/ora100_mt_lt.so
ServerType      = Oracle 10.x
Username        =
Password        =
Database        =
Options         =
FetchBufferSize = 99
ReadOnly        = no
DeferLongFetch  = no
JetFix          = no
Description     = Sample Oracle 10.x Lite Connection
</pre><br>All modifications except the Driver value will be saved when reinstalling this or any other Lite Driver.
<br></li>
<li> For most Lite drivers the <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> (or <tt>SHLIB_PATH</tt> or <tt>LIBPATH</tt>) environment variables must be set before you can load the driver.
 You will not find these in the <tt>$OPENLINKINI</tt> file, as the settings there are set by the driver after it has loaded.
<br><ul><li> If the installer finds relevant environment variables, e.g., <tt>ORACLE_HOME</tt>, it will note the appropriate <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> settings, and add them automatically to the <tt>openlink.sh</tt> script.
 This file should always be run before trying to use the Lite Drivers, e.g.: <br><br><pre><br>. ./openlink.sh
</pre><br></li>
<li> If this script is not properly executed, the system library loader will give an error message stating it cannot find some dependent shared libraries to load.
<br></li>
</ul></li>
