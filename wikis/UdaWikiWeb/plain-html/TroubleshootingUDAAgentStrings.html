<p>Database Agent Version Strings produce the following information:</p><ul><li> <strong>Agent Name</strong> - Is the named agent compatible with the DBMS? <br></li>
<li> <strong>Version Information</strong> - Is the agent current? Is the agent version associated with specific limitations, formal bugzillas, or other known problems? <br></li>
<li> <strong>Compilation Platform</strong> - Compare the compilation platform information with the output of <tt>uname -a</tt> on the affected server.
 Is the agent compatible with that operating system?</li>
</ul><p>Finally, version string errors provide useful, diagnostic information.
 Failure to produce version strings often stems from one of three problems:</p><ul><li> The agent does not exist on the system.
<br></li>
<li> Permissions prohibit the execution of the agent.
<br></li>
<li> The agent has library issues.
 Typically, the agent requires the addition of the database lib sub-directory to <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>, <tt>LIBPATH</tt> (AIX), or <tt>SHLIB_PATH</tt> (HP/UX).</li>
</ul><p>Note: Database Agent Version Strings should be compared to Request Broker Version Strings and Client Version Strings to insure compatibility.
 Compatibility and stability problems arise, when Multi-Tier component versions differ.
