</pre><p> <br>These configuration options are generally best used only with a very large license, when resources on the Broker host are being exhausted by too many client connections.
 Such situations are rare, and thus the default and our general recommendation is to leave these options commented out (with the leading &quot;;&quot;), or set to their default (&quot;0&quot;, meaning no limit).</p><p> <br></p><h2><a name="Exceeding license limits (any product)"></a> Exceeding license limits (any product) </h2>

<p>This error message may be seen when an old version of the Apache web server is part of your ODBC client deployment.</p><p>Among other issues, Apache 1.3.2.7 and previous versions leaked file descriptors to child processes, such as CGI, PHP, and Perl scripts, which may make calls to our ODBC Driver.
 When these leaks happen, rather than releasing the file descriptor for our ODBC Driver, the script keeps a hold on the driver, which in turn continues to use up a license.</p><p>These leaks were resolved in Apache version 1.3.2.8, and we strongly recommend that all Apache users upgrade to this version or later.</p><p> <br></p><h2><a name="Evidence"></a> Evidence </h2>
