<p>JBench is a Java and JDBC based adaptations of the industry standard TPC-A benchmarks.
 This program helps you compare the performance of OpenLink<a href="http://wikis.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/UdaWikiWeb/OpenLink&parent=BenchTestingJDBCDrivers" class="wikiword">?</a>&#39;s Virtuoso against other backend database engines, it also helps you to compare the performance of various JDBC Drivers connecting to any JDBC compliant backend database.</p><p> <br>1.
 Go to the <nop></nop>OpenLink Data Access Drivers &quot;Start Menu&quot; program group and then follow the JDBC Samples--&gt;Jbench (for JDK1.1 1.2 or 1.3) menu path, depending on the JVM you have installed.
 This will execute a DOS batch program that initializes the JBench application.</p><p>Figure: 1 <br> <br> <br><img src="BenchTestingJDBCDrivers/JBENCH1.png" style="wikiautogen"></p><p>2.
 The follow the File--&gt;Connect menu path to make your initial connection.
 You will need to identify your JDBC Driver (by providing appropriate Driver Name values in the JDBC Driver field) and then provide a valid JDBC URL for your specific JDBC Driver.</p><p>Figure: 2 <br> <br> <br><img src="BenchTestingJDBCDrivers/JBENCH2.png" style="wikiautogen"></p><p>3.
 Select the open JDBC connection that you wish to test.</p><p>4.
 Follow the TPC-A--&gt;Load Tables menu path to prepare your database for the TPC-A benchmark, select a database schema type that matches the database engine that you are benchmarking.
 If your database isn&#39;t listed ANSI should suffice (as long as this is an ANSI SQL compliant database).</p><p>Figure: 3 <br> <br> <br><img src="BenchTestingJDBCDrivers/JBENCH3.png" style="wikiautogen"></p><p>5.
 Follow the TPC-A--&gt;Load Procedures menu path to Load the TPC-A stored procedures.</p><p>6.
 Now that all the benchmark data and stored procedures have been loaded into your database, follow the TPC-A--&gt;Run Benchmark menu path and then configure your actual benchmark session parameters:</p><p>The benchmark parameters fall into 4 categories, Bench execution mode, Run Options, SQL Options, and Execution Options.</p><p>Figure: 4 <br> <br> <br><img src="BenchTestingJDBCDrivers/JBENCH4.png" style="wikiautogen"></p><h4><a name="Bench execution mode:"></a>Bench execution mode:</h4>
<p>These setting allow you to configure the threads used for the benchmark.</p><p>Decide on a single or multiple threads test.</p><p>No.
 Threads</p><p>this is the number of concurrent threads to be used during the benchmark.</p><h4><a name="Run Options:"></a>Run Options:</h4>
<p>These setting allow you to configure the duration related aspects of this benchmark program.</p><p><strong>No.
 runs</strong></p><p>this controls how many iterations of the benchmarks you actually run (the default is 100 benchmark iterations).</p><p><strong>Duration (mins.)</strong></p><p>this is the duration in minutes of each benchmark run.</p><h4><a name="SQL Options:"></a>SQL Options:</h4>
<p>These setting allow you to configure how your benchmark&#39;s SQL instructions are actually handled.</p><p><strong><nop></nop>ExecDirect with SQL Text</strong></p><p>this means that no form of repetitive SQL execution optimization is being applied (SQL statements are prepared and executed repetitively)</p><p><strong>Prepare/Execute Bound Params</strong></p><p>this means that the Parameter Binding SQL execution optimization is being applied (SQL is prepared once but executed many times without the overhead of re-preparing statements prior to execution)</p><p><strong>Use Stored Procedures</strong></p><p>this means that the Stored Procedure SQL optimization is being applied (benchmark instructions are stored within database being benchmarked)</p><p><strong>Execution Options:</strong></p><p>These setting allow you to configure the tone of your benchmark, for instance it could have Transaction scoping and a mix of record retrieval queries, or it could simply be input and update intensive with a minimal amount of record retrieval queries (the case when the 100 row query checkbox is unchecked a typical OLTP scenario)</p><p><strong>Use Transactions</strong></p><p>make the benchmark use transaction control (instructions are scoped to transaction blocks)</p><p><strong>Do 100 row Query</strong></p><p>perform a simulation of a 100 record retrieval as part of the benchmark activity.</p><p>7.
 Press Run or Run All to start your TPC-A benchmark.
 The Run All will sequence through all SQL and Execution combinations, so it will take much longer.</p><p>8.
 Follow the TPC-A--&gt;Cleanup menu path to clean up your database so that you can then run other benchmarks.</p></div></body></html>
