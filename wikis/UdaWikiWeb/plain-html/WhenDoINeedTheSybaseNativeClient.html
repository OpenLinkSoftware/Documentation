<nop></nop><p>OpenLink&#39;s current data access products do not use the Sybase native client.
 Use of the Sybase native client was deprecated with the advent of <nop></nop>OpenLink 4.0.</p><p>There are two scenarios in which you would require the Sybase native client.
 You must install the Sybase client on the same machine as any 1.x or 3.x Single-Tier driver.
 Additionally, you must install the Sybase client on the same machine as <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Request Broker and Sybase Database Agent, if the Broker and Sybase Agent do not reside on the same machine as the Sybase database, and the Sybase Agent is version 1.x or 3.x.
