---+Configuring User Agent Identity used by Sponger

---++What?
How to configure the User Agent Identity used by a Virtuoso Sponger instance.

---++Why?

Increasingly, for a variety of reasons, Web sites and Data Spaces will constrain access to resources (documents) based on the identity of a user agent. This feature enables you control how your instance of the Virtuoso Sponger is identified, distinct from other instances. 

---++How?

In order to configure the HTTP client's user agent string, one should set the <code>ClientIdString</code> parameter in the Virtuoso INI file:

<verbatim>
...
[HTTPServer] 
ClientIdString = xx 
...
</verbatim>
