This version includes a major rewrite of the database engine, giving drastic speed improvements on both single- and multiple-CPU architectures, both to the SQL engine and RDF Views (SQL-RDF mapping).

This release has full text indexing of literal objects in triple patterns, basic inferencing (subclass and subproperty support), SPARQL update language support and aggregate functions, and improved support for the XML Schema Type System (bif:xcontains).
