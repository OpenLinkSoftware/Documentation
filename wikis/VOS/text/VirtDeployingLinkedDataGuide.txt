---+Deploying Linked Data

This document describes the process of deploying Linked Data into the existing Web.  It discusses some of the difficulties faced in exposing RDF data and in bridging the "Linked Data Web" and the traditional "Document Web".  Two generic approaches to resolving these deployment challenges are described, content negotiation and URL rewriting, before looking at [[http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/][OpenLink Virtuoso]], both from the standpoint of how it implements these solutions and how Linked Data is deployed.

A companion document, <i>[[http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/Whitepapers/pdf/Virtuoso_SQL_to_RDF_Mapping.pdf][Virtuoso Linked Data Views - Getting Started Guide (PDF)]]</i>, focuses on Virtuoso Linked Data Views, a facility for exposing relational data as RDF.  In addition, it provides useful background information for readers unfamiliar with RDF and outlines some of the key technologies of the Linked Data Web.
