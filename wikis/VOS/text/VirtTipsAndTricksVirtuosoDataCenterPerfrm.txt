---+What are the specifics for Performance metrics?

Interleaving online operations and data loading is not a problem. One can count 10K triples load rate per core if operating in memory. For example loading on one core and doing online queries on 7 cores should present no problem.

The system keeps a running count of different database operations performed on each connection, e.g. random index access, sequential index access, disk read etc. These can be programmatically accessed using the [[http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/databaseadmsrv.html#clientlevelresourceaccounting][db_activity ()]] SQL function.
