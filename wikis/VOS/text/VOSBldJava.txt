---+Building the Virtuoso Server with Java Hosting Support

---++ Version Supported

To build the Virtuoso server with Java hosting you first need a JDK installed. The lastest JDK 1.5 can be downloaded from http://java.sun.com/ . 

---++ Configure and Compilation

To build virtuoso with Java hosting support, use  the "--with-jdk3=[DIR]" configuration switch, specifying a directory if `java' is not in your PATH, or if you have multiple JDKs installed.

If this is specified, the build process will additionally make an executable called virtuoso-javavm-t.  Use this executable in place of virtuoso-t when intending to host Java server-side.
