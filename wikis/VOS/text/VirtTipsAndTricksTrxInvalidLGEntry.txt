---+ How do I recover from "Invalid log entry in replay" when transaction log is being replayed during server start?

%TOC%

---++ Error Condition

A Virtuoso transaction log file may fail to replay, with an error of the form:
<verbatim>
11:42:57 Invalid log entry in replay. Delete transaction log virtuoso.trx or truncate at point of error. 
Valid data may exist after this record. A log record begins with bytes 193 188 5 188 0. Error at offset 13205546
11:42:57 Searching for the next valid header signature starting at 13205547
11:42:57 No valid looking header found.
11:42:57 Server exiting
</verbatim>

Resolution of this error varies with the kind of Virtuoso server you're running.

---++ Recovery Methods

---+++ Single-Server Deployments of both Open Source and Commercial Edition

<i><b>WARNING:</b> Do not use this recovery method on Cluster Deployments of Commercial Edition.</i>

This can be recovered by truncating to the transaction log to the reported error offset.  

Unix-like OS can use the built-in <code>dd</code> command; Windows users must first install [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/windd/][WinDD]] or [[http://www.cygwin.com/][cygwin]] to get the same functionality.

Given the error above, the recovery steps on a Unix-like OS would look like --
<verbatim>
# mv virtuoso.trx old.trx
# dd if=old.trx of=new.trx bs=1 count=13205546
13205546+0 records in
13205546+0 records out
# mv new.trx virtuoso.trx
# virtuoso-iodbc-t -f
</verbatim>

Restarting Virtuoso should now succeed.
