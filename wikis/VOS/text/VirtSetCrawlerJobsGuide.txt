---+ Quad Store Data Loading via Virtuoso's In-built Content Crawler

This guide covers the use of Virtuoso's in-built content crawler as a mechanism for scheduled of one-off data loading operations for its native quad store. 

---++ Why is this important?

Transforming external data sources into Linked Data "on the fly" (e.g., via the 'Sponger') is sufficient for many use cases, but there are times when the volume or sheer nature of a data source makes batch-loading necessary. For example, Freebase offers RDF representations of its data, but it doesn't publish RDF dumps; even if it did, such dumps would usually be outdated by the time they were loaded. Thus, a scheduled crawl of that resource collection offers a viable alternative.

---++ How to Set Up the Content Crawler for Linked Data generation and import

The Virtuoso Conductor can be used to set up various Content Crawler Jobs:

   * [[VirtSetCrawlerJobsGuideSitemaps][Setting up a Content Crawler Job to Retrieve Sitemaps]] (when the source includes RDFa)
   * [[VirtSetCrawlerJobsGuideSemanticSitemaps][Setting up a Content Crawler Job to Retrieve Semantic Sitemaps]] (a variation of the standard sitemap)
