   * <b>[[http://svn.aksw.org/projects/GeoKnow/Public/D2.6.1_Prototype_of_Built-in_Complex_Geo_Problem_Solving.pdf][GeoKnow D 2.6.1]]:  Graph Analytics in the DBMS</b> (2015-01-05)
%BR%%BR%
This introduces the idea of unbundling basic cluster DBMS functionality like cross partition joins and partitioned 
group by to form a graph processing framework collocated with the data.

   * <b>[[http://svn.aksw.org/projects/GeoKnow/Public/D2.4.1_Geospatial_Clustering.pdf][GeoKnow D2.4.1]]:  Geospatial Clustering and Characteristic Sets</b> (2015-01-06)
%BR%%BR%
This presents experimental results of structure-aware RDF applied to geospatial data.  The regularly structured part 
of the data goes in tables; the rest is triples/quads.  Furthermore, for the first time in the RDF space, physical 
storage location is correlated to properties of entities, in this case geo location, so that geospatially adjacent 
items are also likely adjacent in the physical data representation.

   * <b>[[http://lod2.eu/Deliverable/D2.1.5.html][LOD2 D2.1.5]]: 500 billion triple BSBM</b> (2014-08-18)
%BR%%BR%
This presents experimental results on lookup and BI workloads on Virtuoso cluster with 12 nodes, for a total of 3T RAM 
and 192 cores.   This also discusses bulk load, at up to 6M triples/s and specifics  of query optimization in scale-out settings.

   * <b>[[http://lod2.eu/Deliverable/D2.6.html][LOD2 D2.6]]:  Parallel Programming in SQL</b> (2012-08-12)
%BR%%BR%
This discusses ways of making SQL procedures partitioning-aware, so that one can, map-reduce style, send parallel 
chunks of computation to each partition of the data.

%BR%%BR%
This paper discusses the future evolution of the LDBC Social Network Benchmark and gives a preview of Virtuoso graph traversal performance.

   * <b>Minh-Duc, Pham, Linnea, P., Erling, O., and Boncz, P.A. "[[http://homepages.cwi.nl/~duc/papers/emergentschema_www15.pdf][Deriving an Emergent Relational Schema from RDF Data]]," WWW, 2015.</b>
%BR%%BR%
This paper shows how RDF is in fact structured and how this structure can be reconstructed.  This reconstruction 
then serves to create a physical schema, reintroducing all the benefits of physical design to the schema-last world.  
Experiments with Virtuoso show marked gains in query speed and data compactness.

This is a summary of all factors that make up analytics performance by those who know.  The Virtuoso 
[[http://www.openlinksw.com/weblog/oerling/?id=1739][TPC-H blog series]] is a further development and 
commentary on these same truths.

%BR%%BR%
This paper introduces the Virtuoso column store architecture and design choices.  One design is made 
to serve both random updates and lookups as well as the big scans where column stores traditionally 
excel.  Examples are given from both TPC-H and the schema-less RDF world.

This paper introduces anytime query answering as an enabling technology for open-ended querying of large 
data on public service end points.  While not every query can be run to completion, partial results can 
most often be returned within a constrained time window.

This paper introduces the still challenging RDF-H benchmark, an RDF translation of the classic TPC-H.  
Running this over SPARQL to SQL mapping is considered.

This is an initial discussion of RDF support in Virtuoso.  Most specifics are by now different but this 
can give a historical perspective.
