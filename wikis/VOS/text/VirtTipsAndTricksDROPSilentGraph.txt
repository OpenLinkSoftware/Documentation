---+How can I drop a graph for which is not clear was it created explicitly or not?

If you are not sure whether a given graph is created explicitly or not, in order to drop the graph use 
the <code> DROP SILENT GRAPH </code> statement:
<verbatim>
DROP SILENT GRAPH <http://example1.com>

callret-0
Drop silent graph <http://example1.com> -- done
</verbatim>

If a given graph is created explicitly however, i.e. using the <code> CREATE GRAPH </code> statement:
<verbatim>
CREATE GRAPH <http://example2.com>

callret-0
Create graph <http://example2.com> -- done
</verbatim>

then you can use <code> DROP GRAPH </code> in order to drop the graph:

<verbatim>
DROP GRAPH <http://example2.com>

callret-0
Drop graph <http://example2.com> -- done
</verbatim>
