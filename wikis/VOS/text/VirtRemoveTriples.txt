---+Removing all triples from a Virtuoso Server instance

There are times it can be useful to remove all triples from Virtuoso Server. There are a few ways to accomplish this.

%TOC%


---++Remove all triples including those in the the system graphs

Use *iSQL*, either on the command-line or through the *Virtuoso Conductor* -> *Database* -> *Interactive SQL*, to execute this SQL query --

<verbatim>
SQL> DELETE FROM DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD ;
</verbatim>


---++Remove all triples except those in the system graphs

---+++ Use the built-in RDF&#95;GLOBAL&#95;RESET procedure

   1 When removing large graphs or numbers of triples it is advised/required to change the transaction log mode to <code>autocommit</code> with no transaction logging on each operation, deleting the graph(s) or triples, and then setting the log mode back to its original setting. This is easily done using the Virtuoso <code>[[http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/fn_log_enable.html][log_enable]]</code> function, with the settings <code>log_enable(3,1)</code>. 
   1 Use *iSQL*, either on the command-line or through the *Virtuoso Conductor* -> *Database* -> *Interactive SQL*, to execute this SQL query --
<verbatim>
SQL> RDF_GLOBAL_RESET ();
</verbatim>
   1 Now selecting all graphs from your db should return only the system graphs, like so --
<verbatim>
SQL> SPARQL
SELECT  DISTINCT ?g
  FROM  <http://localhost:8894/>
  {
    GRAPH  ?g   
      { ?s  a  ?t }
  } ;

g
ANY  http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#
No. of rows in result: 1
</verbatim>


---+++ Write your own procedure

Take all non-system graphs, and for each of them execute:
<verbatim>
SPARQL CLEAR GRAPH <The Graph URI here> ;
</verbatim>
