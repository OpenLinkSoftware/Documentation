---++LinkedIn Meta-Cartridge 

The meta-cartridge looks for foaf:Person instances in the source graph being enriched then, using the person's foaf:name, searches against 
LinkedIn to get their public profile URL. The public profile URL is then exposed as an rdfs:seeAlso link in the source graph. When de-referenced, 
this link is materialized by the LinkedIn extractor cartridge into a Linked Data representation of that person's LinkedIn profile.

The LinkedIn meta-cartridge must be configured with a LinkedIn API key and session key. These are specified through the cartridge options 
<nowiki>consumer_key</nowiki> and <nowiki>consumer_secret</nowiki>. It can share the same LinkedIn API and session keys used by the LinkedIn extractor cartridge. For details of 
how to configure the latter, please see [[http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/dataspace/dav/wiki/Main/VirtCartConfigLinkedIn][here]].

The meta-cartridge also requires a LinkedIn OAuth access token with which to sign API requests. It automatically uses the first available unexpired access token registered for the extractor cartridge.
