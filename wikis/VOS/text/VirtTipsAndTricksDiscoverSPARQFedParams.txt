---+Discover parameters used by SPARQL services that don't support SPARQL-FED
---++What? 
Many public SPARQL endpoints are SPARQL-FED compliant, which makes use of SPARQL-FED unpredicatable.

---++Why? 
A SPARQL endpoint mesh without SPARQL-FED support undermines the power of SPARQL in general i.e., the fact that its inherently distributed, unlike SQL.

---++How?
You can discover parameters used by SPARQL services that don't support SPARQL-FED, in regards to SPARQL query solution (results) publication, and then use them in SPARQL-FED. for example by executing the following query:
<verbatim>
SELECT DISTINCT ?EntityType
WHERE 
  {
    SERVICE <http://admin.numismatics.org/nomisma/query?output=xml>
      {
        SELECT * 
         WHERE 
           { 
             ?Entity a ?EntityType
           } 
        LIMIT 50
      }
  }
</verbatim>
