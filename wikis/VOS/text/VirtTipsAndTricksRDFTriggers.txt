---++What are "Generate RDB2RDF triggers" and "Enable Data Syncs with Physical Quad Store" Linked Data Views options?

These Linked Data Views options basically persist the triples in the transient View Graph in the Native Quad Store. 
The Data Sync is how you keep the transient views in sync with the persisted triples.

Without this capability you cannot exploit faceted browsing without severe performance 
overhead when using Linked Data based conceptual views over ODBC or JDBC accessible data sources.


Note: Using these options when the RFViews have already been created is not currently possible 
via the Conductor UI. Instead you should be able to add them manually from isql:
   1 Drop the Linked Data View graph and Quad Map 
   1 Create it again with the RDB2RDF Triggers options enabled.
