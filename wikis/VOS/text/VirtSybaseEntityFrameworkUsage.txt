---+  Using Microsoft Entity Frameworks to Access Sybase Schema Objects with Virtuoso

This document details the steps required to provide Microsoft Entity Framework access to Sybase Schema Objects using the <nop>OpenLink Virtuoso Universal Server. This is achieved by linking the required Sybase Schema objects into Virtuoso using its built in Virtual Database engine, and then using the Virtuoso ADO.NET Entity Framework provider to query the remote Sybase Schema objects linked into the Virtuoso Server.

%TOC%

---++ Prerequisites

The following must be in place to complete this exercise.

   1 <b>Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (or later)</b>%BR%
Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 (or later) is required, as previous versions do not include the necessary Entity Framework support.%BR%%BR%
   1 <b>Virtuoso ADO.NET Entity Framework Provider, v5.10 or later</b>%BR%
The ADO.NET Entity Framework Provider must be installed on the Visual Studio development and deployment host(s). Version 5.10.x or later is required, as previous versions do not include the necessary Entity Frameworks support.%BR%%BR%
   1 <b>Virtuoso Universal Server, v5.10 or later</b>%BR%
Virtuoso Universal Server Release 5.10 or later is required, as previous versions do not include the necessary Entity Frameworks support.  This may be on any host which is TCP/IP accessible from the Visual Studio development and deployment host(s).%BR%%BR%
   1 <b>ODBC Driver for Sybase</b>%BR%
The Virtuoso Server uses an ODBC Driver for Sybase to link in the Sybase Schema Objects. The <b><nop>OpenLink Single-Tier ODBC Driver for Sybase</b> will be used in this document, and a functional ODBC Data Source Name (DSN) of "<b><code>syb15ma</code></b>" will be assumed to exist on the machine hosting the Virtuoso Server.  Any ODBC compliant driver for Sybase should work.%BR%%BR%
   1 <b>Sybase DBMS</b>%BR%
A Sybase DBMS hosting the required Schema Objects needs to be available. This may be on any host which is TCP/IP accessible from the Virtuoso Server host. In this document, the Sybase <b>pubs2</b> database will be used to demonstrate the process.%BR%%BR%


---++ Tasks

   1 <b>Ensure Sybase Primary Keys (PKs) are not nullable</b>%BR%
The Visual Studio 2008 Entity Data Model (EDM) requires that all primary keys are *NOT* Nullable. Visual Studio 2008 will fail to generate an EDM if any are. Therefore, ensure any primary keys to be used are defined as not nullable in the Sybase database schema before attempting to generate an EDM. In the case of the Sybase pubs2 database all primary keys are non nullable. Thus, this should not be an issue in this case.%BR%%BR%
