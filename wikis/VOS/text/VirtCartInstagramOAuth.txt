---+Instagram Cartridge - Configuration Guidelines

%TOC%

---++ Register an application endpoint

Use Instagram's developer interface to register a [[http://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/][new client endpoint]].

The settings required for this are:

   * Application Name: whatever you like ("my Sponger instance")
   * Description: optional, free-form
   * Website: set this to the base of your Virtuoso installation, e.g. http://localhost:8890/
   * OAuth redirect_uri: adjusting localhost and port number to your installation, put http://localhost:8890/sponger/instagram_oauth  in here (note no trailing slash)

Once the client is created, it should give you a paragraph of its options including
a client_id and a client_secret.

---++Cartridge Options

In the Virtuoso Conductor (eg http://localhost:8890/conductor), select the menu
item Linked Data -> Sponger -> Extractor Cartridges.

In the list of cartridges, ensure `Instagr.am Photos' is enabled (hit `Apply' at
the bottom if need be), then click on the name "Instagr.am Photos" to show its options:

The API Key should be the Client_ID parameter from Instagram.

The client_secret option is currently unused, but may be set against future updates.

The oauth-fallback cartridge option is a default username to use for
authenticated requests. Currently, this is only used in order to list a user's
media; if an access token for the user being sponged is not found, this will be
used in its place - so you get a view from this user's perspective.

---++View the Retrieved data

The cartridge will trigger on URLs matching either
<nowiki>^https?://(www.)?instagr.am/.*</nowiki> or
<nowiki>^https?://(www.)?instagram.com/.*</nowiki>; this caters for both old and
new (after July-2012) patterns.
