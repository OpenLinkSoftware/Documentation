---+++ 2010-02-03: Announcing Virtuoso Open-Source Edition v6.1.0

OpenLink Software is pleased to announce the official release of Virtuoso Open-Source Edition, Version 6.1.0:

<i><b>***IMPORTANT NOTE*** for upgraders from pre-6.x versions:</b> 
The database file format has substantially changed between VOS 5.x and 
VOS 6.x. To upgrade your database, you must dump all data from
the VOS 5.x database and re-load it into VOS 6.x.  Complete instructions 
may be found [[UpgradingToVOS610][here]].</i>


<i><b>***IMPORTANT NOTE*** for upgraders from earlier 6.x versions:</b> 
The database file format has not changed, but the introduction of a newer
RDF index requires you run a script to upgrade the <code>RDF_QUAD</code> 
table. Since this can be a lengthy task and take extra disk space (up to twice 
the space used by the original <code>RDF_QUAD</code> table may be required 
during conversion) this is not done automatically on startup.  Complete instructions 
may be found [[UpgradingToVOS610][here]].</i>
