| <code>[[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=virtuoso-announce][virtuoso&#8209;announce]]</code>  | This is a very low volume list for authoritative announcements from OpenLink Software concerning new releases.

Topics include assistance with initial binary building, starting instances, using OpenLink Data Spaces (ODS) applications through their web-based interfaces, general "how do I...?" questions, optimization concerns, etc.  |
| <code>[[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=virtuoso-devel][virtuoso&#8209;devel]]</code>  | This is for matters where you need to address the Virtuoso development team with a potential problem. Discussion of confirmed or possible bugs are welcome.  |
