---+ <nop>OpenLink-supplied Virtuoso Sponger Cartridges

There are a few kinds of Cartridge, and many of each kind are included in a standard Virtuoso installation.

%TOC% 

---++ Extractor Cartridges

An Extractor Cartridge processes a Resource of a given format, extracting RDF according to rules appropriate to that format.  External data does not come into play; only the content of the Resource fed to the Sponger.

---+++ Supported Standard Non-RDF Data Formats 

These Cartridges handle open formats &mdash; typically community-developed, openly-documented, and freely-licensed data structures.

---+++ Supported Vendor-specific Non-RDF Data Formats 

These Cartridges handle closed formats &mdash; typically proprietary; sometimes undocumented; possibly licensed to no-one except the format originator. Sometimes data may not be parsed as desired or expected, as many of these Cartridges have required reverse-engineering of the data format in question.

---++ Meta Cartridges

A Meta Cartridge submits a Resource to a third-party Web Service for processing. Returned RDF supplements the RDF generated by Extractor and other Meta Cartridges. Locally generated RDF may also be submitted to the third-party services, instead-of or in-addition-to the original Resource itself.

Default Sponger behavior is for all installed Meta Cartridges to be brought to bear on all submitted Resources.
