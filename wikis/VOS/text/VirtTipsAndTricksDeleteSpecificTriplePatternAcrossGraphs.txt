---+How Can I Delete a Specific Triple Across Graphs?


<i>Suppose the following situation</i>: 

   * There is a specific triple somewhere in a massive dataset in a Virtuoso DBMS. 
   * There are too many possible named graphs associated with the pattern so <b>SPARQL DELETE</b> (which requires <b>FROM i.e., Named Graph</b> scoping) isn't adequate.

<i>What is the solution?</i>

Using SQL you can execute the following:
<verbatim>
SQL> SPARQL
DELETE FROM rdf_quad 
WHERE s = iri_to_id ('http://linkeddata.uriburner.com/about/id/entity/http/twitter.com/kidehen') 
  AND o = iri_to_id ('http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Document') 
  AND p = iri_to_id ('http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type');
</verbatim>
