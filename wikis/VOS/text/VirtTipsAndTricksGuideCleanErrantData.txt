---+++What?
Cleaning up errant data using SPARQL Update Language.

---+++Why?
All data endeavors involve varying degrees of prospective and 
retrospective error correction.


---+++How?
Given a triple in a Virtuoso Quad store that contains an errant URI e.g. one that accidentally contains spaces, here is a SPARQL example that showcases how to delete said triple using a built-in function:

<verbatim>
DELETE FROM <your_graph> 
  { 
    `iri("http://isbsg.clearbluewater.com.au/wsf/datasets/378/Capers Jones_107_12122011081257")` 
     a <http://isbsg.org/ontology/data/Dataset>  
  };
</verbatim>
