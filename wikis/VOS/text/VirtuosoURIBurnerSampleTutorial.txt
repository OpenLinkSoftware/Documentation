---+++URIBurner Sample Tutorial

The following tutorial demonstrates a simple scenario of tracking Kingsley Idehen's conversations across the Web, using the Virtuoso Faceted Browser hosted on URIBurner.


   1 Go to <code>http://uriburner.com/fct/ </code>
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f1.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Enter a free text search pattern (for example, "<code>Kingsley Idehen</code>"), and click Search
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f2.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1 Your initial query results page will display a list of literal value snippets from property values associated with the query text pattern
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f3.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Using the Navigation section on the right, click on "<b>Types</b>", which alters the contents of the query results area by presenting [[http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/][CURIE based hyperlinks]] for each of the Entity Types associated with Property values that contains the query text pattern
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f4.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Click on the "<b>foaf:Person</b>" link to narrow the result set down to Entities of this Type, un-hatch the checkbox beside this link for Negation (filtering out) based on this Entity Type
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f5.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. You can filter further, by switching (pivoting) to the a Property based view, by returning to the Navigation section and then clicking on "Properties" or "Referencing Properties" links; in either case, you have further filtering of based on the combination of Properties and Entities where Entities in the result-set contain values matching the query text pattern
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f6.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. From the list of Property Types, click on the "<b>foaf:interest</b>" link to filter further, based on the values of this property
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f7.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. From the list of "foaf:interest" Values, click on "<b>dbpedia:Linked_Data</b>", which filters the result-set further to display reveal Entity Identifier Links (Generic HTTP URIs) and Labels for each "foaf:Person" associated with the property "foaf:interest", in the URIBurner data space. At the time of writing guide, there is only one Entity of Type: foaf:person, and the Generic HTTP URI for this Entity is: http:///www.openlinksw.com/dataspace/person/kidehen@openlinksw.com#this.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f8.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Click on one of the HTTP URIs in the filtered results-set to obtain a detailed structured description of a given Entity.  Each listed Property is a <b>Link</b>; thus, each Property is a link to other structured Entity descriptions
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f9.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Click on "<b>Usage Statistics</b>" link to get a summary view of this Linked Data Space, "Reference" and "Source" graphs are akin to saying "Table X" and "Table Y" where each table is the container of Records re. 
RDBMS or Worksheet re. Spreadsheet.:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f10.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f11.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1 "Direct" and "In-Direct" co-references show other references (Identifiers) that relate associated with Kingsley Idehen (like saying: here are his other names or his know by this name in this other place)
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f12.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f13.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Click on "Settings" check "owl:sameAs" and it sets a context mode for the session (meaning: a set of rules to take place)
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f14.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1 Go back to the "Direct Co-reference" tab
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/f15.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1 As result each link will unveil a union (combination) of all the the data associated with all Kingsley Idehen's other Identifiers (other Names in other places), i.e., they all show the same data.
