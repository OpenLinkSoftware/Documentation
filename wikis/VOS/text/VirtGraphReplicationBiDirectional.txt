---++Prerequisites

---+++Database INI Parameters

Suppose there are 2 Virtuoso instances respectively with the following ini parameters values:

   1. virtuoso1.ini:
<verbatim>
...
[Database]
DatabaseFile    = virtuoso1.db
TransactionFile = virtuoso1.trx
ErrorLogFile     = virtuoso1.log
...
[Parameters]
ServerPort               = 1111
SchedulerInterval        = 1
...
[HTTPServer]
ServerPort                  = 8891
...
[URIQA]
DefaultHost = localhost:8891
...
[Replication]
ServerName   = db1
...
</verbatim>
   1. virtuoso2.ini:
<verbatim>
...
[Database]
DatabaseFile    = virtuoso2.db
TransactionFile = virtuoso2.trx
ErrorLogFile     = virtuoso2.log
...
[Parameters]
ServerPort               = 1112
SchedulerInterval        = 1
...
[HTTPServer]
ServerPort                  = 8892
...
[URIQA]
DefaultHost = localhost:8892
...
[Replication]
ServerName   = db2
...
</verbatim>
 

---+++Database DSNs

Use the ODBC Administrator on your Virtuoso host (e.g., on Windows, *Start* menu -> *Control Panel* -> *Administrative Tools* -> <b>Data Sources (ODBC)</b>; on Mac OS X, <code><nowiki>/Applications/Utilities/OpenLink ODBC Administrator.app</nowiki></code>) to create a System DSN for db1 and db2 with names db1 and db2 respectively.

---+++Install Conductor package

On each of the 2 Virtuoso instances install the [[https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/download/][conductor_dav.vad]] package.

   1 Click Upload
   1 A successful upload will result in a shown message.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/bd33.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Check the count of the inserted triples by executing a query like the following against the SPARQL endpoint, 
http://localhost:8892/sparql:
<verbatim>
SELECT COUNT(*) 
   FROM <http://example.org>
WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }
</verbatim>
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/bd34.png" />%BR%%BR%
