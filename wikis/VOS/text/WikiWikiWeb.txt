WikiWikiWeb is a common name for a class of very simple content management system,
invented by Ward Cunningham.
It allows a Web site to be written by its users;
anyone can modify any page or create new pages wihout even rudimentary knowledge of HTML.
User edit the content of a page in plain text format, using some very simple
formatting rules. The server utility called "Wiki engine" parses the text and
converts it into well-formed HTML where pages are properly interconnected.
Wiki engine also indexes these pages to make links bidirectional: one can
both follow links from a given page and go to pages that refer to the given one.
