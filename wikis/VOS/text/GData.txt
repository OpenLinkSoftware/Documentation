---++Google Data (GData) API Protocol 

GData is a new protocol created by Google that provides the following RESTful Web Services (meaning this serves consumer and provider applications):

   1 Free Text (or Full Text) querying of content contained within a Data Space (an Atom-based implementation of the RSS-oriented OpenSearch API from Amazon)
   1 Content [[CRUD]] (Create, Update, Delete) functionality including [[OptimisticConcurrency][Optimistic Concurrency]]
   1 Authentication
   1 Atom 1.0 Content Syndication

---++Google's Reasons for producing GData

Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Making information accessible requires making it available in contexts other than a web browser. Thus, Google provides APIs to let client software request information outside of a browser context.

GData provides a general model for feeds, queries, and results. You can use it to send queries and updates to any service that has a GData interface.

Syndication is an effective and popular method for providing and aggregating content. GData provides a way to expand the types of content that Google can make available through syndication; in particular, it lets you use the syndication mechanism to send queries and receive query results. GData also lets you send data to Google, and update data that Google already has.
