<para>A <emphasis>dynamic folder</emphasis>, also known as a <emphasis>DAV Extension Type</emphasis> or <emphasis>DET</emphasis>, is a <ulink url="WebDAV">WebDAV</ulink> collection whose contents are determined at access time by program logic.
 It must at least offer a list of its contents and enable retrieval of that content with GET.
 Additionally, PUT may be used to add new resources or replace existing content.</para>
<para>The data accessed in a dynamic folder is typically not executable.
 The content may be all physical, all virtual, or a mixture of physical and virtual resources, as is the case with the <emphasis>category view</emphasis> (Item collection in Briefcase).
 Each dynamic folder exists as a physical collection in <ulink url="WebDAV">WebDAV</ulink>, i.e., it has a corresponding row in SYS_DAV_COL, which is used to specify the hook functions used to make or manipulate the content.</para>
