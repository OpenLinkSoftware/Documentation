    <h3><a name="The Soul of a New Web"></a>The Soul of a New
    Web</h3>
    <p>"Social Networking", once an inscrutable term, is redefining
    the future of the World Wide Web. We are all destined to be
    bent to the will of innovation as the Web inexorably
    transitions from islands of content to a fully meshed fabric.
    Web 1.0's model of agglomerations of sites we shared with
    friends or use at work, are constructs of a mental hierarchy,
    but not of a concrete fabric. This is changing as we speak.</p>
    <p>The next web is currently under construction. The hyped
    Web-2.0 is a mystery in embryo, for any concept that cannot be
    clearly defined in a few short paragraphs must be suspect.
    However, we are living vividly in the crossover of Web2.0
    times. Social bookmarks, tagging, and blogs are the mere
    infancy of this semantic web. Even words used to describe the
    revolution are obscure, for outside of academia, where is the
    vocabulary of semiotics so bandied about. The definition of
    semantic is, "relating to meaning or the differences between
    meanings of words or symbols". So far so good. Web 2.0 will be
    content with meanings (tags) attached, and an architecture to
    liberate this semantic content into cyberspace (via RSS and
    other XML systems) so that it may be shared, marshalled,
    syndicated, and subscribed-to.</p>
    <h3><a name="Syndication and Weblogs"></a>Syndication and
    Weblogs</h3>
    <p>Blogs are today's best example of Social Networking on the
    Web. Blogging is personal publishing as a series with the
    addition of syndication. Blogs are composed of public diaries,
    articles, commentary, and reporting on a variety of subjects.
    Diversity of subject matter is what makes this a thriving,
    popular medium, while free and low cost Blogging accounts are
    as easy to obtain. Why the fuss' Haven't personal web sites
    been available for years' What's the difference between Web
    Content and Blogging content' In a nutshell: simplicity,
    syndication, semantics, and aggregation.</p>
    <p><span class="c2">Simplicity</span> of enrollment, posting,
    and commentary management. These attributes have not been a
    solution set in the personal web services space.</p>
    <p><span class="c2">Syndication</span> is the magic of RSS
    (Real Simple Syndication) and other XML protocols that are
    largely transparent to the blog user. There may be subtle
    differences as to how these strange settings and attributes
    affect availability of future "social networking" functions and
    publishing options. It must be underlined that XML protocols
    used in Blogging are easily transmutable into almost any other
    type of syndication protocol' for this is magic of XML '
    separation of content from presentation and structure.</p>
    <p><span class="c2">Semantics</span> is the ability to add
    "tags" to your blog posts. Tags are words that confer meaning
    to you or your social network. Sites like del.icio.us or
    Technorati will use these tags to aggregate your blog and help
    others find it. Clouds of tags and semantically tagged content
    is automatically built by an increasing number of Web 2.0
    sites; not all of these are blog-related, some are
    business-oriented.</p>
    <p><span class="c2">Aggregation</span> is the act of blog
    engines pushing to popular collection points, or the reverse,
    content pulled from your blog to the aggregator. An upstream is
    an explicit destination that the blog account user configures
    with credentials, but many blog engines automatically ping
    popular aggregation sites. There is almost always a way to
    enable posts to be marked as private and excluded from entering
    the Bloggosphere.</p>
    <p>Blog systems provide a simple publication interface, for
    push-button publishing capabilities. Blog posts are usually
    retained for archival purposes, affording readers the
    opportunity to digest content entries dating back to the
    beginning of that particular blog. Blogs often allow the
    readers to contribute to the content entries via commenting
    systems, and allow author's to have administrative control of
    the comment stream.</p>
    <p>Traditional web sites required authors to publish content
    using web-authoring tools and the use of presentation markup,
    making sites hard to maintain, difficult to extend, and
    requiring the author to manually manage the article publishing
    in series format. There were, and still are, on-line
    Web-authoring tools that allow Newsletter publishing, comment
    management, and even email notification of new postings but
    these systems have been supplanted by a maelstrom of blog
    tools, and the furor that has engulfed the Blogging
    phenomenon.</p>
    <h3><a name="Basic Blogging Capabilities"></a>Basic Blogging
    Capabilities</h3>
    <h4><a name="Templating" id="Templating"></a>Templating</h4>
    <p>Templating is used to control the look and feel of the
    weblog, both its container and the content itself. Obviously,
    everyone has their own idea of how their content should be
    presented, and they'd like to be able to present that content
    in a way that is as close to their wishes as possible.</p>
    <p>Templating facilitates these needs by providing a set of
    pre-defined presentation options. Many systems allow authors to
    modify these templates as well as create their own from
    scratch, while some even allow the content author to include
    dynamic content through programmatic means as they would be
    exposed in their hosted environment.</p>
    <h4><a name="Syndication" id="Syndication"></a>Syndication</h4>
    <p>Syndication is the process of advertising content via
    Subscription Channels such as News Aggregators, Portals, and
    other Weblogs.</p>
    <p>Syndication is similar to Browser Bookmarking with one
    important difference. The endpoint of a Browser Bookmark is a
    web page, while the endpoint of a syndicated link is an XML
    file that represents summary information of the various posts
    that are available in your web log. In this way, syndication
    allows your content to travel across the Internet to and among
    interested parties rather than requiring them to browse to your
    content.</p>
    <p>There are several methods of syndication, the most popular
    of which are the RSS and ATOM specifications. In addition to
    these syndication methods, OPML files allow a person or web
    site to make a list of many possible syndication channels
    available in the form of an outline file.</p>
    <h4><a name="Comments" id="Comments"></a>Comments</h4>
    <p>Occasionally a blog post may touch you in such a way that
    you feel compelled to respond to it publicly. Fortunately, many
    web log systems allow you to do this. In a sense, a blog
    becomes a threaded discussion tool instead of simply a soapbox
    from which a person may shout.</p>
    <p>Because the public's passions may be a bit too extreme for
    the type of forum that you've established, systems that support
    commenting will generally also support editorial and permission
    capabilities, allowing the moderator to delete inappropriate
    comments as well as establishing membership rules for the
    people who may be granted the right to post comments.</p>
    <p>Some systems also provide the ability for those comments to
    be retrieved programmatically via Subscription Channels.</p>
    <h4><a name=
    "Pingbacks, Trackbacks and Permalinks"></a>Pingbacks,
    Trackbacks and Permalinks</h4>
    <p>The problem of tracking and organizing the web logs that one
    reads is becoming increasingly more difficult as that list of
    web logs grows. In order to allow notifying one of interesting
    content, notifying an author that somebody has linked to their
    blog, and allowing a person to safely bookmark a specific blog
    post, several tracking and linking mechanisms have been
    envisioned.</p>
    <p>Pingbacks are a method for web authors to automatically be
    notified when some entity links to their content. This is
    beneficial because it both allows the web log author to get a
    better idea of who is reading their blog, as well as providing
    the potential for a network of semantically related web
    logs.</p>
    <p>Trackbacks are a way of notifying interested parties that
    pertinent content has been made available in a blog. For people
    who read quite a bit of web content, it's not often practical
    to visit or scan new postings. Trackbacks provide a more
    contextually relevant method of notifying a blog consumer that
    something interesting awaits them in their blog reading
    queue.</p>
    <p>Permalinks are non-transient URLs that allow a person to
    create a hyperlink reference to a specific blog post.
    Permalinks are important because a blog's main page will change
    over time, causing older posts to roll off and become archived.
    A permalink is a static link to a specific blog posting,
    allowing a person to bookmark that post as well as providing a
    cleaner entry point for search engines.</p>
    <h4><a name="Multimedia" id="Multimedia"></a>Multimedia</h4>
    <p>In blogging, it is becoming increasingly common to attach
    multimedia content (such as photos, audio, or video) to a post,
    sometimes even promoting that content to be the body of the
    post itself.</p>
    <p>The methods offered to provide this capability vary, ranging
    from crude to very elaborate.</p>
    <p>In the most crude scenario, a web log system may not provide
    additional space for storing multimedia content, requiring the
    author to upload their content to a third-party location, and
    then link to that content from their blog posts.</p>
    <p>In a perfect world, a blogging system might expose a
    <a href="http://vos.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/VOS/WebDAV"
    class="wikiword">WebDAV</a> repository that the author can
    attach to their system as if it were another disk drive. This
    would allow them to add and remove multimedia content simply by
    dragging and dropping that content between their local file
    system and the remote <a href=
    "http://vos.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/VOS/WebDAV"
    class="wikiword">WebDAV</a> system.</p>
    <p>For a blog system to truly support multimedia content, it
    should be able to wrap multimedia references in its syndication
    payload. This allows the multimedia to become a first class
    citizen of a subscription channel, providing the foundation for
    specialized blogs such as PhotoBlogs (where photographs are the
    content) and PodCasts where the blog content is actually an
    audio program.</p>
    <h3><a name="Advanced Blogging Capabilities"></a>Advanced
    Blogging Capabilities</h3>
    <h4><a name="Automatic Categorization"></a>Automatic
    Categorization</h4>
    <p>It is not uncommon for a web log author to write about a
    variety of different topics. With as much content as some web
    log authors produce, it's often convenient to categorize their
    posts so that readers may only see a selected 'view' of the
    particular categories in which they're interested. This is
    where being able to categorize blog posts comes in handy.</p>
    <p>Categorization generally allows a blog author to define a
    set of categories under which their content may fall. Then,
    while authoring new content, one or more categories may be
    selected in to properly categorize the new posting.</p>
    <p>Some posts will include words or phrases that will easily
    identify the post as being part of a certain category. Some
    blogging systems allow a content author to associate certain
    keywords with the categories that they have defined. These
    keywords, when encountered in a new blog post will
    automatically align that blog post with the category or
    categories to which the keywords are associated.</p>
    <p>Categorization may also be leveraged to assist the blogging
    system with the automatic upstreaming of content from the
    current blogging system to a related web log.</p>
    <h4><a name="Upstreaming" id="Upstreaming"></a>Upstreaming</h4>
    <p>Web logs don't exist in a vacuum. Often is the case that a
    content author maintains several web logs for reasons such as
    distinguishing between a work and personal content, or perhaps
    they contribute to a web log that publishes the work of several
    people. Whatever the case, authoring content that needs to be
    published to more than one web log occurs quite frequently
    these days, and it's rather inconvenient to have to post the
    same content several times to different systems.</p>
    <p>Upstreaming is the ability to author blog content in one
    location, and have the blogging system automatically post that
    content in other locations based on the content of the
    post.</p>
    <p>Blogging systems that support upstreaming will typically
    allow a content author to associate a set of categories with a
    target web log. When a new post is made, that post will be
    transmitted to all of the target systems that are associated
    with the post's assigned categories.</p>
    <p>Upstreaming can become tricky when you are publishing to
    several blogs whose blogging software expose different posting
    protocols. The unfortunate reality is that most blogging
    systems expose different, incompatible protocols. Even more
    unfortunate is that the author won't have much control over the
    protocols that these systems do expose. The best solution would
    be to leverage a blogging system for their own purpose that
    supports as many upstream protocols as possible.</p>
    <h4><a name="Tagging or Social Bookmarking"></a>Tagging or
    Social Bookmarking</h4>
    <p>One of the most arduous tasks that directory services on the
    Internet (such as Google and the Open Directory Project) have
    had is the problem of properly categorizing the millions of web
    pages of which they maintain an active index. This difficulty
    has become magnified with the information explosion that has
    occurred due to the widespread adoption of weblogs and
    wikis.</p>
    <p>Social bookmarking services such as <a href=
    "http://del.icio.us/" class="absuri">del.icio.us</a> address
    some of the maintenance difficulties associated with
    traditional directory services by allowing anyone to register
    URLs, associating tags (categories) and notes with those URLs.
    As a by-product of this tagging, the service organically grows
    as a directory, distributing the categorization burden across
    the large number of people who contribute to the social
    bookmarks.</p>
    <p>Instead of manually adding your new posts to the social
    bookmarks, or waiting for someone to stumble across your
    content and perform the task for you, wouldn't it make more
    sense for your blogging system to automatically contribute to
    the social bookmarking system based on the categories that
    you've already established' This would provide immediate
    availability as opposed to the extended turn-around times
    generally associated with traditional directory services.</p>
    <h4><a name="Scalability" id="Scalability"></a>Scalability</h4>
    <p>Blogging systems come in all shapes and sizes, and they're
    implemented in a myriad of different ways. Ultimately, people
    and organizations may select a particular blogging system based
    on their immediate needs, neglecting to thoroughly invest the
    research into their future needs and whether or not their
    selection will be capable of addressing them.</p>
    <p>Future needs usually revolve around the issue of scaling.
    Specifically, they revolve around concerns related to the
    bandwidth required to both publish content as well as serve
    that content to readers and subscription channels.</p>
    <p>In addition to this, the portability of the content that is
    managed by the blogging system may become a concern for many
    reasons. In particular, an organization may find that they need
    to extract their current content so that it may be imported
    into a new blogging system. An organization may also want
    access to their content for programmatic analysis and
    manipulation.</p>
    <p>For these reasons, it's important to select a blog system
    that doesn't tie your hands when issues of scalability and
    portability are involved. Storing its data in a relational data
    model is generally a good way for a blog system to open up its
    content for programmatic access. It also opens up scaling
    possibilities to an organization's systems architect.</p>
    <h4><a name="Community Blogging"></a>Community Blogging</h4>
    <p>Organizations are increasingly allowing and even encouraging
    their members to maintain mission-related web logs. By doing
    so, they are developing an on-going knowledge base that can be
    drawn from for a variety of reasons.</p>
    <p>On its own, web logging is valuable, but in the context of
    groups, it becomes a powerful communication tool. Imagine a
    software company that develops several products. Each of these
    products has a separate team who engineers the various facets
    of that product. From a grouping perspective, it might be
    valuable to aggregate the content produced by each member of a
    team, so that when an engineer posts a new web log article,
    that article not only becomes part of his or her blog, but also
    becomes part of the team's blog as a whole.</p>
    <p>This type of automatic aggregation is called Community
    Blogging, and unlike upstreaming, where content is aggregated
    remotely via certain criteria, community blogging is an
    automatic function of a person contributing content within the
    realm of a group.</p>
    <h4><a name="Advanced Querying"></a>Advanced Querying</h4>
    <p>The content exposed as part of a web log is a potentially
    valuable information base, especially if the web log is focused
    on publishing content that relates to specific topics.
    Additionally, aggregating content that a web log exposes via
    subscription channels expands the domain of available
    information out between the related web logs of other
    authors.</p>
    <p>Querying this data, and not just its content, but also its
    structure presents a significant opportunity to allow blog
    content to graduate from simply being a string of words to
    being semi-structured data. Being able to search a blog based
    on the title and rating of movies that somebody has reviewed
    would be a good example of a situation where the structure of a
    post is even more important than its content. If all of the
    reviews are structurally consistent, then the reviews
    effectively become a database against to query.</p>
    <p>This type of advanced querying can't be performed using
    traditional full text searching capabilities. Instead, a
    combination of full text and a structural query language such
    as XQuery needs to be employed. Utilizing XQuery to identify
    the parts of a post that are movie titles and ratings might
    enable this form of advanced data querying.</p>
    <h4><a name="Dynamic Content"></a>Dynamic Content</h4>
    <p>Dynamic Content in blog posts, especially in an enterprise
    environment allows a blog post to become more than just static
    data, but a dynamically mutable, or even interactive piece of
    content.</p>
    <p>For example, let's say that you're posting a blog article
    that mentions a certain company's stock position, but you'd
    like to do it in such a way that it always displays the
    company's current position, rather than a static snapshot of
    what you were able to ascertain at the time of authoring the
    content. How could you accomplish this?</p>
    <p>One way would be to leverage the blogging system's native
    dynamic page facilities to perform a back-end download from a
    stock web site, extracting the necessary data, and emitting it
    as part of the dynamic result of the blog content.</p>
    <h3><a name="Blogging with ODS Weblog"></a>Blogging with ODS
    Weblog</h3>
    <p>Now that you understand the value of Weblogs, you may ask
    yourself, why ODS Weblog' The answer is simple, but deserves a
    bit of explanation.</p>
    <p>ODS Weblog an application component of OpenLinks<a href=
    "http://vos.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/VOS/OpenLinks&amp;parent=Blog2Whitepaper"
    class="wikiword">?</a> <a href=
    "http://vos.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/VOS/DataSpace"
    class="wikiword">Data Space</a> is integrated with Virtuoso
    unified storage and ODS Briefcase, which facilitates effective
    flow of enterprise information. A mere fraction of enterprise
    information is stored in the database proper, while the
    majority remains untapped and 'in the wilds of the file
    system'. A compelling argument if ever there was one for
    Virtuoso's core mission of everaging disparate information in a
    source independent fashion.</p>
    <p>Information stored as blog content may be important to an
    organization, particularly if subscriptions or publications
    contain information vital to the business. Blogs become a
    knowledge base for organizing content and an atomic
    representation of that knowledge.</p>
    <h4><a name="Installing ODS Weblog"></a>Installing ODS
    Weblog</h4>
    <p>Virtuoso is easily extended using VAD (Virtuoso Application
    Distribution) system. VAD encapsulates the components of a
    self-contained Virtuoso application, including table creation,
    default data, stored procedures, web services, and content. The
    ODS Weblog is installed as a VAD.</p>
    <p>Installing a VAD in Virtuoso is a simple process;. use the
    Virtuoso Conductor interface to install VAD dependent modules,
    followed by the Weblog VAD itself. After installation, create
    an individual blog instance.</p>
    <h4><a name="Installing the necessary files"></a>Installing the
    necessary files</h4>
    <p>The VAD file that contains the ODS Weblog platform is called
    blog_dav.vad Use the Virtuoso Conductor interface to install
    the VAD.</p>
    <p>For the sake of this installation, we'll be accessing the
    Virtuoso demo database. This database in included as part of a
    standard installation of the Virtuoso Universal Server. By
    default, it can be accessed using a web browser on port 8890 of
    the machine on which it's installed. If you're using the
    computer that the Virtuoso demo database is installed on,
    simply point your web-browser at the following URL: <a href=
    "http://localhost:8890/conductor/" class=
    "absuri">http://localhost:8890/conductor/</a></p>
    <p>This is Virtuoso's Conductor Interface. On the left side of
    your screen, you will be prompted for your username and
    password. These are the DBA user name and password that you
    were prompted to enter as part of the Virtuoso demo database
    installation.</p>
    <p>After you have logged in, click on the top rightmost link
    labeled "System Admin". This will display a sub- menu of system
    administration related actions. At the moment, you're
    interested in "Packages", so click on that link.</p>
    <p><br />
    <img src="Blog2Whitepaper/Conductor_VAD_sm.png" alt=
    "Conductor_VAD_sm.png" width="547" height="316" /></p>
    <p>The "Packages" tab of the System Administration functions
    displays the list of currently installed VAD packages. A basic
    installation of Virtuoso, will display a "conductor" package.
    If "ods_dav" and "blog_dav" is listed, the required VAD
    packages are already installed on your Virtuoso demo
    server.</p>
    <p>If you need to proceed to installing the blog VAD, start
    with the prerequisites:</p>
    <p>The ODS VAD package (blog, oDrive (ODS Briefcase), etc.) is
    required by ODS suite of applications that Virtuoso provides as
    extensions. To install the <a href=
    "http://vos.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/VOS/OpenLink"
    class="wikiword">OpenLink</a> <a href=
    "http://vos.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/VOS/DataSpace"
    class="wikiword">Data Space</a> VAD, click the radio button
    "Upload package", then click 'Browse' to find the wa.vad file
    on your local hard drive. Once you have found the ods_dav.vad
    file, click the 'Proceed' button to install it. If successfully
    installed, proceed to install the blog_.dav.vad file in the
    same manner.</p>
    <h4><a name="Creating a Weblog Instance"></a>Creating a Weblog
    Instance</h4>
    <p>A single Virtuoso server may host many blogs. Therefore, it
    is necessary to create individual weblog instances. This is
    done via the <a href=

    <p>To access the ODS package's configuration interface, type
    the following URL into your web browser: <a href=
    "http://localhost:8890/ods/" class=
    "absuri">http://localhost:8890/ods/</a></p>
    <p>This will summon the ODS management console. Proceed to log
    into the system.</p>
    <p>You will need to create a ODS user account to serve as owner
    of your weblog (and other web applications). To register a new
    account, enter your login name, a valid email, a password,

    <h4><a name="Configuring a Web Log"></a>Configuring a Web
    Log</h4>
    <p>You now have a listing for the blog instance that you
    created. It's time to configure your blog! Select the settings
    on the main navigation toolbar and then link 'Preferences' on
    the left hand menu.</p><br />
    <img src="Blog2Whitepaper/Weblog_Preferences_sm.png" alt=
    "Weblog_Preferences_sm.png" width="562" height="394" />
    <p>Click the 'Blog Settings' tab. Notice that the description
    previously entered for the blog instance is now your blog
    Title.</p>
    <p>Most configuration options are self-explanatory.
    "Categories", "Channel Subscriptions", and "Upstream"
    configuration may require modest examination in order to fully
    understand advanced functions.</p>
    <h4><a name="Configuring Categories"></a>Configuring
    Categories</h4>
    <p>Categories allow one to categorize blog postings into
    groups. Categories allow readers to locate content within a
    specific context, and allow the automatic upstreaming of blog
    postings to specific weblogs, perhaps located outside of the
    corporate firewall.</p>
    <p>The configure Categories, you use the Categories interface
    which is available by clicking the 'Categories' link on the
    margin of your blog when you are logged in.</p><br />
    <img src="Blog2Whitepaper/Weblog_Categories_sm.png" alt=
    "Weblog_Categories_sm.png" width="561" height="360" />
    <p>One may define keywords triggers for automatically
    categorizing content. For example, the word 'xhtml' may be used
    to automatically categorize your content as a "World Wide Web"
    category for content aggregation.</p>
    <h4><a name=
    "Configuring Home Page Links (Channel Subscriptions)"></a>Configuring
    Home Page Links (Channel Subscriptions)</h4>
    <p>Blog content is published and distributed using a
    syndication mechanism such as RSS (Really Simple Syndication)
    or ATOM. Among the other advantages of syndication, this
    content encoding allows authors to incorporate summary rolls
    (blog rolls) from other blog authors as content appearances on
    one's own web log.</p>
    <p>Home Page Links allows the maintenance of a list of
    Blogrolls, presenting this content to readers of one's own
    blog. For example, imagine reading a story about web logging on
    CNet. Including these blog posts via the Home Page Links
    interface and editing the Link Categories enables you to do
    just that.</p><br />
    <img src="Blog2Whitepaper/Weblog_HomePageLinks_sm.png" alt=
    "Weblog_HomePageLinks_sm.png" width="560" height="354" />
    <p>To configure Channel Subscriptions, you must collect the
    feed URI. This is accomplished by identifying the xml or rss
    feed button within a browser or newsreader user interface.
    There is a great deal of variation in the way particular web
    sites and blogs present feed information; yet another aspect of
    a new era and young technology.</p>
    <h4><a name="Configuring Upstreams"></a>Configuring
    Upstreams</h4>
    <p>Upstreaming is a powerful feature. Content authors may
    maintain several blogs targeted at diverse subscriber
    populations. Upstreaming allows an author to publish content to
    multiple Blogging systems by associating up-streams with
    content categories or specific keyword tags. A single post to a
    local Virtuoso web log may be propagated to multiple blogs
    obviating the need to manually republish content.</p><br />
    <img src="Blog2Whitepaper/Weblog_Upstreams_sm.png" alt=
    "Weblog_Upstreams_sm.png" width="562" height="407" />
    <p>Configuring up-streams requires knowledge of the destination
    blog URL, user account and password, and posting API of the
    target web logging system.</p>
    <h4><a name="Templates" id="Templates"></a>Templates</h4>
    <p>ODS Weblog supports the ability to alter look and feel of
    blogs using presentation templates. Several default templates
    are provided.</p>
    <h4><a name="Your First Blog Post"></a>Your First Blog
    Post</h4>
    <p>So now that you've configured your new web log, you'll no
    doubt want to begin posting your ideas and stories to it. In
    order to do this, you'll need to head to your Blogs home page.
    Do you remember the value that you entered for the "Blog home"
    field when you created your Blog instance' You'll need this to
    browse to your Blog. The URL will be something like
    this:</p><br />
    <pre>http://localhost:8890/weblog/[yourname]
</pre>
    <p>Once you're successfully browsed to your Blogs home page,
    you'll need to log in to the Blog with your username and
    password (if you're not already logged in), and you'll be
    provided with a convenient interface for entering your Blog
    post directly into the Blog page itself.</p><br />
    <img src="Blog2Whitepaper/Weblog_NewPost_sm.png" alt=
    "Weblog_NewPost_sm.png" width="560" height="455" />
    <p>When you're satisfied with your Blog post, simply click the
    'Post' button, and you've taken your first step into the world
    of web logging.</p>
    <h3><a name="Blogging Compatibility"></a>Blogging
    Compatibility</h3>
    <p>One of the major benefits of ODS Weblog application is that
    it supports nearly every client/server blogging protocol
    available. What this means is that you aren't strictly bound to
    using the web-based interface for blog reading or content
    composition. There are many stand-alone desktop blogging tools
    available, and nearly all of them are compatible with ODS
    Weblog.</p>
    <p>This section explains how to configure a desktop blogging
    tool for use with ODS Weblog. It will discuss the process for
    several blogging tools, both for the Mac OS X and Windows
    operating systems. What you will ultimately see is that the
    process is incredibly simple, often requiring nothing more than
    pointing the blogging client to the home page of your Blog.</p>
    <p>While reading the following tutorials, it's important to
    understand that these products are not produced by <a href=
    "http://vos.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/VOS/OpenLink"
    class="wikiword">OpenLink</a> Software, and so the
    configuration process, imagery, and feature sets from version
    to version are liable to change. Because of this, only the
    process of establishing a connection to a Virtuoso hosted blog
    is discussed. An in-depth discussion of the features and
    browsing or content creation process is best left to the
    end-user documentation of the product in question.</p>
    <h4><a name="Ecto (Mac OS X)"></a>Ecto (Mac OS X)</h4>
    <p>Ecto is a blog-authoring client developed by Kula Co. It is
    available for both Mac OS X and Windows, but this article will
    focus on the Mac OS X implementation.</p><br />
    <img src="Blog2Whitepaper/Weblog_Ecto_sm.png" alt=
    "Weblog_Ecto_sm.png" width="523" height="395" />
    <p>Configuring Ecto for use with ODS Weblog is rather easy,
    consisting only of pointing Ecto at the blog's home page. From
    there, Ecto will be capable of automatically detecting the type
    of discoverable blogging protocols that are available, upon
    which the client will populate a set of default
    preferences.<br />
    <b>Step 1:</b> In order to point Ecto to your blog's home page,
    you will need to access the Account Manager window. You can
    call this window up by typing "Option-Apple-A". Once this
    window is visible, you can begin adding a new account by
    clicking the 'Add' button in the Account Manager's
    toolbar.<br />
    <b>Step 2:</b> After you've clicked the Add button, a sheet
    will appear with a single text entry field in it. This sheet is
    requesting the address of the web log that you'd like to
    manage. You enter the same web address that you'd previously
    used to browse to your blog. (i.e. <a href=
    "http://localhost:8890/weblog/" class=
    "absuri">http://localhost:8890/weblog/</a>[yourname]). After
    you've entered this address, click the 'next' button.<br />
    <b>Step 3:</b> If all goes well, the next page of the sheet
    should display a set of default settings for connecting to your
    blog. You need only click the 'next' button at this
    point.<br />
    <b>Step 4:</b> You must now provide your username and password
    credentials for editing the blog. These are the credentials
    that you established when registering with the <a href=
    "http://vos.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/VOS/OpenLink"
    class="wikiword">OpenLink</a> Web Applications system.<br />
    <b>Step 5:</b> You will then be asked to provide a name for the
    account. This can be any name that you like, but it should be
    used to easily identify this particular account. Ecto allows
    you to connect to and edit many blogs simultaneously. After
    you've entered a name, click the 'next' button.<br />
    <b>Step 6:</b> At this point, Ecto will attempt to connect to
    your blog to verify your settings. If successful, it will
    present you with a set of check boxed choices. Check or uncheck
    the boxes depending on your personal preferences, and click the
    'next' button.</p>
    <p>At this point, you will receive confirmation that your blog
    settings have been entered. Simply click the 'Finish' button to
    begin blogging.</p>
    <h4><a name="PulpFiction (Mac OS X)"></a>PulpFiction (Mac OS
    X)</h4>PulpFiction is a news aggregator designed specifically
    for Mac OS X by Freshly Squeezed Software. It is meant to be
    incredibly easy to use, with the ability to automatically
    filter the content of subscriptions into one to many
    groups.<br />
    <img src="Blog2Whitepaper/Weblog_Pulpfiction_sm.png" alt=
    "Weblog_Pulpfiction_sm.png" width="523" height="400" /><br />
    PulpFiction, like most news aggregator allows you to subscribe
    to individual news feeds, or subscribe to them in bulk using
    its OPML import capabilities.
    <p>As an experiment, let's subscribe to Kingsley Idehen's
    Weblog using the subscribe feature, and to Kingsley's Blog Roll
    using the OPML import feature.<br />
    <b>Step 1:</b> Browse to Kingsley Idehen's Weblog using your
    favorite web browser. Kingsley's blog can be found
    at:<br /></p><br />
    <pre>http://www.openlinksw.com/blog/~kidehen/ 
</pre><br />
    <b>Step 2:</b> Subscribe to Kingsley's Blog by Control-Clicking
    on the [RSS] icon in the upper-left of the web page, and
    selecting 'Copy Link' in the pop-up menu. After that, go to
    PulpFiction, type 'Shift-Apple-S', and paste the RSS feed's
    location into the text input field. After you've done this,
    click the 'Add' button.<br />
    The RSS feed location should be:<br />
    <pre>http://www.openlinksw.com/blog/~kidehen/gems/rss.xml
</pre>
    <p><br />
    After you've done this, Kingsley's news feed should begin to
    populate your PulpFiction inbox.<br />
    <b>Step 3:</b> Switch back to your web browser, and save
    Kingsley's Blog Roll by Control-Clicking on the OPML icon to
    the right of 'Blog Roll' on the right column of Kingsley's
    blog. After you've done this, select 'Download Link File' or
    'Save As'' from the pop-up menu. Save this file to your
    Documents folder as 'kingsley.opml'.<br />
    <b>Step 4:</b> Switch to PulpFiction, and import Kingsley's
    Blog Roll by typing 'Shift-Apple-I' and then selecting
    'kingsley.opml' from your Documents folder.<br />
    <b>Step 5:</b> At this point, you will be presented with a list
    of news feeds. You can check all of them or only the ones that
    you might be interested in. Once you've selected a set of news
    feeds, click the 'Add' button. At this point, articles from the
    news feeds that you've selected should begin to populate your
    PulpFiction inbox.<br />
    PulpFiction allows you to create and manage folders that can
    then be used to automatically route articles rather than
    defaulting to your inbox. This makes tracking many
    subscriptions a bit more intuitive.</p>
    <h4><a name="SharpMT (Windows)"></a>SharpMT
    (Windows)</h4>SharpMT is a blog authoring client developed by
    Randy Santi for Windows and the .NET Runtime. It has been
    developed specifically for MoveableType blogging servers, but
    because ODS hosted weblogs are compatible with MoveableType.
    <p>Configuring SharpMT for use with ODS Weblog is a little more
    complicated than Ecto, requiring some amount of manual
    configuration, but it's good to know some of the technical
    underpinnings of blog APIs.<br />
    <b>Step 1:</b> In order to point SharpMT to your blog's home
    page, you will need to access the SharpMT Options dialog. You
    can call this dialog up by clicking on the 'Tools' menu, and
    then selecting 'Options''. Once this dialog is visible, you can
    begin filling in the required fields to point SharpMT to your
    blog.<br /></p>
