<!--End of %TOC{}%--><h2><a name="Why rewrite URLs?"></a> Why rewrite URLs?</h2>
<p>Some applications should support obsolete syntaxes of URLs of pages that were presumably bookmarked by users of old versions.
Some applications generate long URLs with many parameters, so the URL does not fit into a standard e-mail line length or is otherwise inconvenient.</p>
<p>But even more importantly, many web crawlers have difficulty crawling web pages with parameters, and others will simply ignore them or value them less because they are considered highly dynamic.</p>
<p>So the purpose is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" class="absuri">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</a> and eventually to help humans to easily recognize the URL.
(This is a portion of the user experience with a web page, so a &quot;nice URL&quot; could ultimately be considered a User Interface feature.)</p>
<p>In the rest of the document, &#39;long&#39; URLs are those with named parameters after &#39;?&#39;, while &#39;nice&#39; URLs have data encoded in some other format.</p>
<p>It is possible to have pages that are called via &#39;nice&#39; URLs using plain VHOST functionality and redirects to pages with long URLs, but this result in an extra HTTP loop and invalidates &#39;back&#39; button browser navigation.</p>
<p>A more accurate solution is to provide an intermediate URL rewriter that can be enabled for some sorts of URLs and which transparently alters the parsed parameters: </p>
<ul><li>The <code>http_physical_path()</code> function returns the path to the actually-called page.
</li>
<li>The &#39;<code>path</code>&#39; parameter remains the same, even if the actually-called page has different location.
</li>
<li>The &#39;<code>params</code>&#39; parameter is not what&#39;s parsed from &#39;nice&#39; URL, but is the result of that parsing.
</li>
<li>The &#39;<code>lines</code>&#39; parameters are extended by 1 parameter line, called &#39;<code>X-VirtuosoRewrite</code>&#39;, for handlers that should know about both the source and the destination.</li>
</ul><p>The implementation should be able to handle ill-formed URLs in an understandable way.
 Possible scenarios are: </p>
<ul><li>Ignore rewriting rules, so if the URL looks like a &#39;nice&#39; URL but is not valid &#39;nice&#39;, then no rewriting takes place.
</li>
<li>Make a &#39;default&#39; rewriting that actually change nothing.
</li>
<li>Report a detailed error message.</li>
</ul><p>The default rewriting is a rewriting rule, too.
 So Virtuoso has a list (or even a tree) of rewriting rules to apply to requested URLs.
If none of these rules match, but the default rewriting rule is set, then Virtuoso will try to process it as is.
If none of these rules match and the default rewriting rule is not set, then Virtuoso reports an error.</p>
<h2><a name="Rewriting Rules"></a> Rewriting Rules</h2>
<p>A &#39;rewriting rule&#39; describes how to parse a single &#39;nice&#39; syntax and how to compose a name of the page that should be actually called.
Every rewriting rule has an IRI that is used to refer to the rule.
 Rule IRI is passed as an argument to functions that </p>
<ul><li>compose a nice URL, </li>
<li>add the rule to a rule set (ditto remove), </li>
<li>drop the rule (after removal from all rule sets).
Rewriting rules are of two types, <code>sprintf</code>-based and regex-based.
For purposes of &#39;nice&#39; to &#39;long&#39; conversion, the only difference between them is the syntax of format strings.
But &#39;long&#39; to &#39;nice&#39; conversion works only for <code>sprintf</code>-based rules, whereas regex-based rules are &#39;unidirectional&#39;.</li>
</ul><p>A <code>sprintf</code>-based rule contains following data: </p>
<ul><li><code>rule_iri</code> - Rule name </li>
<li>Rule type </li>
<li><code>nice_format</code> - A format string used by <code>sprintf_inverse</code> to parse the URL into the vector of parts </li>
<li><code>nice_params</code> - A vector of names of parsed parameter; the length of the vector should be equal to number of &#39;<code>%</code>&#39; specifiers in the format string </li>
<li><code>nice_min_params</code> - Minimum allowed number of parameters that should be parsed by <code>sprintf_inverse</code> to treat the parsing as successful </li>
<li><code>target_format</code> - A format string used by <code>sprintf</code> to compose the URL of the destination page </li>
<li><code>target_params</code> - A vector of names of parameters that should be passed to <code>sprintf</code>, in order of their use in format string </li>
<li><code>target_expn</code> - (Optional) SQL text that should be executed instead of an <code>sprintf()</code> call</li>
</ul><p>A regex-based rule contains following data: </p>
<ul><li><code>rule_iri</code> - Rule name </li>
<li>Rule type </li>
<li><code>nice_match</code> - A regex match expression to parse the URL into the vector of occurrences </li>
<li><code>nice_params</code> - A vector of names of parsed parameter; the length of the vector should be equal to number of &#39;<code>(...)</code>&#39; specifiers in the format string </li>
<li><code>target_compose</code> - A regex &#39;<code>compose</code>&#39; expression for the URL of the destination page </li>
<li><code>target_params</code> - A vector of names of parameters that should be passed to &#39;<code>compose</code>&#39; expression as <code>$1, $2,</code> and so on </li>
<li><code>target_expn</code> - (Optional) SQL text that should be executed instead of an regex compose call</li>
</ul><p>Some rewriting rules are preset; their IRIs start from &#39;<code>sys:</code>&#39;.
 Rule called &#39;<code>sys:default</code>&#39; makes no changes in the source: its <code>parse</code> and <code>sprintf</code> formats are both &#39;<code>%s</code>&#39;, both vectors of parsed parameter names are <code>vector(&#39;path&#39;)</code>.</p>
<p>A &#39;rewriting rule list&#39; is a named ordered list of rewriting rules or rule lists.
Rules of the list are tried from top to bottom, the first rule that matches is applied.
When an IRI in a rule list belong to other rule list, all rules and rule lists from &#39;included&#39; list are matched, except rules and rule lists that were matched before, during the recursion.
Rule lists and rules may include each other with &#39;loops&#39; and &#39;diamonds&#39;; this is not a data inconsistency, but allowed use case.
It is also legal for a rule list to be empty.
Nevertheless, rule list can not directly include itself; this is an explicit idiocy.
If no rule matches, a detailed error message is reported.</p>
<p>It is essential to have both &quot;rewriting rules&quot; and &quot;rewriting conditions&quot;.
 Sometimes a URL matches more than one rule.
 This is the case when there are &quot;optional&quot; parameters in the URL.
 So with the &quot;rewriting condition&quot;, we check if a special pattern is present in a URL.
 If so, then you execute the next rewriting rule; otherwise you continue in the rewriting rule set.
 This is the same as the &quot;<code>RewriteCond</code>&quot; in the mod_rewrite Apache module.</p>
<p>Special care should be taken around URL encoding and URL decoding.
 The <code>mod_rewrite</code> Apache module <a href="http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php/2006/07/19/hack_for_the_encoding_of_url_into_url_pr/" class="absuri">required a hack to handle a special case</a></p>

<p>The URL rewriting is enabled by application by providing &#39;url_rewrite&#39; parameter in &#39;opts&#39; list of vhost_define() call.
The parameter value is the IRI of a rule list.
If no matching rule found in the list (during the recursive traversal), a detailed 404 error report is returned.
If a matching rule is found, the &#39;physical&#39; path is substituted, and the search is made for virtual host definition whose host and port are equal to original values, and physical path matches.
If more than one record matches, one with longest physical path prefix is chosen.
If more than one record reaches the longest physical path length, and one of them is the record found for the original logical path, it is chosen.
Otherwise, a detailed 500 error report is returned.</p>
<p>Thus the order of actions that may affect the search for destination page and its properties/permissions is: </p>

</pre><p> The function gets <code>nice_url</code> and tries to find the appropriate <code>HTTP_PATH</code>.
 If found then it performs a recursive traversal of the specified rulelist.
 For every rule in the tree the function implements almost the same logic, no matter what&#39;s the type of the rule, sprintf- or regex- based.
</p>
<ul><li>The input of the rule is resource URL as received from the first line of HTTP header, without named parameters (after &#39;?&#39;) and without the fragment.
 (i.e.
 from the first &#39;/&#39; after host:port to the first &#39;?&#39; or &#39;#&#39; or end of string, whatever is found first.) </li>
<li>The input is normalized, so it becomes uniform: redundant &#39;%NN&#39; are replaced with chars, &#39;%20&#39; are replaced with &#39;+&#39;, chars that violate the URL syntax, like whitespace, are escaped.
 This is a security thing, to avoid dependency between HTTP request syntax and the system response.
</li>
<li>The input is matched against sprintf or regex-match.
 The result is vector of values.
</li>
<li>If regex-based and the match fails then the rule is not applied.
 Try next rule.
</li>
<li>If sprintf-based and the number of parsed parameters is less than threshold then the rule is failed.
</li>
<li>If regex-based then values of parsed parameters should be decoded by <code>split_and_decode()</code>.
</li>
<li>If sprintf-based then the values of parsed parameters should <i>temporarily</i> stay as is.
</li>
<li>Names and values of all named parameters are decoded via sprintf_decode(); decoded values are cached to be reused on next math operations.
</li>
<li>Names and values of all parameters from request body are also decoded via sprintf_decode(); decoded values are also cached.
</li>
<li>The destination IRI is composed.
 The value of each parameter is chosen as a coalesce of value of parameter from the match result, value of named parameter after &#39;?&#39; of &#39;nice&#39; URL, value of named parameter from body of POST request (from &#39;post_params&#39;).
 NULL value after the coalesce result in failed rule, try next rule.
</li>
<li>If regex-based then the destination IRI is parsed to get list of named parameters and fragment, names and values of these parameters are decoded by <code>split_and_decode()</code>.
 The final list of parameters that is visible to application as &#39;params&#39; is a concatenation of <ul><li>parameters from destination URL, </li>
<li>parsed parameters from &#39;nice&#39; URL whose names does not start with &#39;&amp;&#39; char, </li>
<li>named parameters from source URL, as cached, </li>
<li>named parameters from request body, as in post_params.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If sprintf-based then all non-string values of parsed parameters are casted to varchar (e.g.
 &#39;%i&#39; inputs were integers).
 The final list of parameters that is visible to application as &#39;params&#39; is a concatenation of <ul><li>parsed parameters from &#39;nice&#39; URL whose names does not start with &#39;&amp;&#39; char, </li>

</ul></li>
<li>Search for target HTTP_PATH entry is made, according to rules described above (same host/port, longest ppath beginning etc.) </li>
<li>The primary key of target HTTP_PATH is remembered for future references (<code>HP_LISTEN_HIST</code>, PH_HOST, HP_LPATH).</li>
</ul><p>The function returns 1 if there was an actual non-default rewriting and stores its results via &#39;out&#39; parameters: </p>
<ul><li><code>long_url</code> is the URL for destination page, </li>
<li><code>params</code> is the final vector of parameters, </li>
<li><code>nice_vhost_pkey</code> is a vector of pk col of HTTP_PATH row that matches &#39;nice url&#39;, </li>
<li><code>top_rulelist_iri</code> is the rulelist IRI found in HTTP_PATH, </li>
<li><code>rule_iri</code> is one that actually made the successful parsing, </li>
<li><code>target_vhost_pkey</code> is the vector of pk col of HTTP_PATH row whose physical path matched &#39;long url&#39;.</li>
</ul><p>The function may fill some outputs with NULLs, if the execution did not reach some part of processing.</p>
<h2><a name="HTTP Handlers"></a> HTTP Handlers</h2>
<p>The URL rewrite result in an effect that is somewhat similar to <code>IS_REDIRECT_REF()</code>: the data returned relate to a resource that is not equal to the requested resource.
The logical consequence of URL rewriting is quite similar to a redirect stored in DAV.
URL rewriting has smarter processing but almost the same final effect.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an non-obvious debugging problem.
 Changes in URL rewriting and/or <code>VHOST_DEFINE</code> table may result in frequent changes in the returned content, even if destination pages return constant data when called via their &#39;long&#39; URLs.
To make cache live shorter, the standard HTTP response on &#39;nice&#39; URL should return &#39;<code>Last-Modified</code>&#39; that is equal not to resource creation date, but to the most recent of: </p>
<ul><li>resource creation date (as it is returned for request with &#39;long&#39; URL) </li>
<li>the date of last modification of any rewriting rule/ruleset or any virtual host definition.
Thus there&#39;s a need in registry variable that will be updated on every change in HTTP configuration.</li>
</ul><p>Note that this change does not affect the calculation of ETag value! ETag relates to the content of the resource regardless of its location or retrieval URL!</p>
<h2><a name="Composing Nice URLs"></a> Composing Nice URLs</h2>
<p>Two functions are responsible for composing &#39;nice&#39; URLs.
 One gets a ready-to-send path part of &#39;long&#39; URL and a rule or rulelist IRI; the other gets a rule IRI, an array of named parameters, optional protocol, host, port, and fragment parts.
Both either return a &#39;nice&#39; URL or signal an error, indicating that there&#39;s no way of composing the URL by source data.
Both of them use a third (internal) function that returns diagnostics instead of signaling an error: </p>
<br><pre>DB.DBA.URLREWRITE_TRY_INVERSE
   (
     IN     rule_iri                  VARCHAR,
     IN     long_path                 VARCHAR, 
     IN     known_params              ANY,
     IN     param_retrieval_callback  VARCHAR, 
     IN     param_retrieval_env       ANY,
     INOUT  param_retrieval_cache     ANY,
     OUT    nice_path                 VARCHAR, 
     OUT    nice_params               ANY,
     OUT    error_report              VARCHAR
   );
</pre><p> The function tries to rewrite <code>long_path</code> using given rule.
If failed, then <code>nice_path</code> is NULL and <code>error_report</code> contains diagnostics as readable text.
If OK, then <code>nice_path</code> is string and <code>error_report</code> is NULL.
The rule should exist (check needed) and should be <code>sprintf</code>-based; otherwise, the function will fail.</p>
<p>The call of <code>sprintf_inverse</code> applied to <code>long_path</code> may produce values of some parameters.
Other parameters may be passed via <code>known_params</code> variable.
Even after that, the vector of nice parameters may contain more names than the union of these two lists.
To get additional values, function will execute the text of <code>param_retrieval_callback</code> (if it is not null) and pass two values to the <code>exec()</code>: parameter name, and the value of <code>param_retrieval_env</code>.
To avoid extra <code>exec()</code> invocations, every retrieved value is cached in <code>param_retrieval_cache</code> dictionary, so any given additional parameter is retrieved only once per rulelist.</p>
<p>The value of <code>nice_path</code> may contain less parameter values than it was specified by <code>known_params</code> vector.
On success, <code>nice_params</code> is filled with values from <code>known_params</code> that whose names did not appear in the list of &#39;nice&#39; <code>sprintf</code> parameters.
The order is important: parameters in <code>nice_params</code> should be in same relative order as they were in <code>known_params</code>.</p>
