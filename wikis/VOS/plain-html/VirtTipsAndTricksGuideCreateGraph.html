<h2><a name="What?"></a> What?</h2>
<p>Here are some details about the <code>CREATE GRAPH</code>, <code>DROP GRAPH</code>, <code>CLEAR GRAPH</code>, and <code>DELETE FROM &lt;graphname&gt;</code> commands.</p>
<h2><a name="Why?"></a> Why?</h2>
<p>Clarifying implications of the various commands in Virtuoso.</p>
<h2><a name="How?"></a> How?</h2>
<p>In Virtuoso, it does not matter whether <code>CREATE GRAPH</code> and <code>DROP GRAPH</code> (or its synonym, <code>CLEAR GRAPH</code>) are called or not.
 Their purpose is to provide compatibility with the original SPARUL that was designed for Jena.
 Some Jena triple stores require explicit creation of each graph (like <code>CREATE TABLE</code> in SQL), report errors if one tries to create a graph twice, and so on.</p>
<p>For Virtuoso, a new graph is not an important system event, because Virtuoso has a single quad-store shared by all graphs.
 When a graph is made by <code>CREATE GRAPH</code>, its name is placed in an auxiliary table that is used solely to signal appropriate errors when a user tries to <code>CREATE</code> a graph that has already been <code>CREATEd</code>, or to <code>DROP</code> a graph which has not been <code>CREATEd</code>; this table is not used in any way by SPARQL or other subsystems.
 In a perfect world, smart development tools will query that table to give hints to a programmer regarding available graphs, but the reality is not so perfect.</p>
<p>There is an important difference between <code>DELETE FROM &lt;graphname&gt; WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }</code> and <code>CLEAR GRAPH &lt;graphname&gt;</code>.
 Both will delete all triples from the specified graph <code>&lt;graphname&gt;</code> with equal speed, but <code>CLEAR GRAPH</code> will also delete free-text index data about occurrences of literals in this specific graph.
 <code>CLEAR GRAPH</code> will therefor make the database slightly more compact and the text search slightly faster.
 (Naturally, DROP GRAPH makes CLEAR GRAPH inside, not just DELETE FROM...)</p>
<h3><a name="DROP GRAPH and CLEAR GRAPH are equivalent"></a> DROP GRAPH and CLEAR GRAPH are equivalent</h3>
<code>DROP GRAPH</code> is equivalent of <code>CLEAR GRAPH</code>.
 Both require that the graph has been explicitly <code>CREATEd</code>.<p> <i><b>Note:</b> All SPARUL a/k/a SPARQL-Update commands require that the user (i.e., the <code>SPARQL</code> user for the default <code>/sparql</code> endpoint) be granted <b><code>SPARQL_UPDATE&quot;</code></b> privilege.</i></p>
<p>Assume the following sequence of commands to be executed from the <code>/sparql</code> endpoint:</p>
<ol><li>Explicitly create a graph: <br><pre><br>CREATE GRAPH &lt;qq&gt;
	
callret-0
Create graph &lt;qq&gt; -- done
</pre><br></li>
<li>If you know the graph was explicitly created, use the simple <code>DROP GRAPH</code>: <br><pre><br>DROP GRAPH &lt;qq&gt; 	
	
callret-0
Drop graph &lt;qq&gt; -- done	
</pre><br></li>
<li>If you don&#39;t know whether a graph was created explicitly or not, you can add the <code>SILENT</code> option: <br><pre><br>DROP SILENT GRAPH &lt;qq&gt; 
	
callret-0	
Drop silent graph &lt;qq&gt; -- done
</pre><br></li>
