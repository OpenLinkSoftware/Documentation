<p>There are times it can be useful to remove all triples from Virtuoso Server.
 There are a few ways to accomplish this.</p>

<h2><a name="Remove all triples including those in the the system graphs"></a>Remove all triples including those in the the system graphs</h2>
<p>Use <b>iSQL</b>, either on the command-line or through the <b>Virtuoso Conductor</b> -&gt; <b>Database</b> -&gt; <b>Interactive SQL</b>, to execute this SQL query --</p>
<br><pre>SQL&gt; DELETE FROM DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD ;

<ol><li>When removing large graphs or numbers of triples it is advised/required to change the transaction log mode to <code>autocommit</code> with no transaction logging on each operation, deleting the graph(s) or triples, and then setting the log mode back to its original setting.
 This is easily done using the Virtuoso <code><a href="http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/fn_log_enable.html" class="absuri">log_enable</a></code> function, with the settings <code>log_enable(3,1)</code>.
</li>
<li>Use <b>iSQL</b>, either on the command-line or through the <b>Virtuoso Conductor</b> -&gt; <b>Database</b> -&gt; <b>Interactive SQL</b>, to execute this SQL query -- <br><pre><br>SQL&gt; RDF_GLOBAL_RESET ();
</pre><br></li>
<li>Now selecting all graphs from your db should return only the system graphs, like so -- <br><pre><br>SQL&gt; SPARQL
SELECT  DISTINCT ?g
  FROM  &lt;http://localhost:8894/&gt;
  {
    GRAPH  ?g   
      { ?s  a  ?t }
  } ;

g
ANY  http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#
No. of rows in result: 1

</ol><h3><a name="Write your own procedure"></a> Write your own procedure</h3>
<p>Take all non-system graphs, and for each of them execute: </p>
<br><pre>SPARQL CLEAR GRAPH &lt;The Graph URI here&gt; ;
