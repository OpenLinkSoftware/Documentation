<p>By default, triple deletion is performed as part of a transaction, which is stored in memory until the operation is completed and committed to the database.
 During typical server operation, deleting one or more graphs containing a large number of triples (generally millions or more) can consume available memory to the point where the operation <i>cannot</i> be completed, and thus the graph(s) cannot be deleted.</p>
<p>Such large graphs can be cleared by changing the transaction log mode to <code>autocommit</code> on each operation, deleting the graph(s) or triples.
 This is easily done using the Virtuoso <code><a href="http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/fn_log_enable.html" class="absuri">log_enable</a></code> function, with the settings <code>log_enable(3,1)</code>.</p>
<p>This function may be called on its own, prior to the delete operation, via iSQL (either command-line or the Conductor variant), as shown: </p>
<br><pre>log_enable(3,1);
SPARQL CLEAR GRAPH  &lt;graph-name&gt;; 
</pre><p> <code>log_enable()</code> may also be called as a pragma specified in a SPARUL query: </p>
<br><pre>SPARQL DEFINE sql:log-enable 3 
CLEAR GRAPH  &lt;graph-name&gt;; 
</pre><p> Triples can also be deleted directly from the <code>RDF_QUAD</code> table via SQL, but note that this method will not remove any free-text index data that might be associated with the graph, which <code>CLEAR GRAPH ...</code> would do automatically.
 The SQL operation would look something like this: </p>
<br><pre>log_enable(3,1);
DELETE FROM rdf_quad WHERE g = iri_to_id (&#39;http://mygraph.org&#39;);
</pre><p> </p>
