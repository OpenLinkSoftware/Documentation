<p>DRAFT Version</p>
<p> as per Mitko I&#39;s implementation:</p>
<ul><li>There are added a number of patches in binsrc/b3s re: making a fct_dav.vad.
</li>
<li>The code run fine on v6single, next will try vos , probably we would need wrappers for cl_exec &amp; dpipe_define in server code.
</li>
<li>The current vad installs facet browser as it is on lod atm, except its VD is <i>fct</i> to do not break eventual existing sites.
</li>
<li>Also it needs a following indexes as in ~libsrc/Wi/clrdfinx2.sql </li>
<li>to have a HOWTO and users to make the indexes them-self . </li>
</ul></div></body></html>
