<p align="center">January 2009</p>

Dear <nop>OpenLink Community,

Happy New Year from everyone at <nop>OpenLink Software! 

In the spirit of the new year, <nop>OpenLink is stocking its product portfolio 
with new offerings, introducing new approaches to old data integration 
hurdles, and challenging traditional concepts of data and computing with 
a paradigm shift that puts virtualized, multi-model DBMSs front and center.  
Strictly relational data access is a thing of the past.  Powerful, 
context-based queries based on the Entity-Attribute-Value model are the 
way of the future, and <nop>OpenLink's Virtuoso Universal Server is the tool 
that will get us there.

Not ready for a paradigm shift? The team has put together a set of 
practical tips and tricks to assist you with your immediate migration 
and integration needs.  Got trouble interfacing data in different DBMSs 
from different vendors? <nop>OpenLink has got you covered.

---++++Virtuoso+Neurocommons EC2 AMI released


The <nop>NeuroCommons project uses Linked Data Web technologies to create 
an open source platform for the management of data pertaining to the 
neurosciences, computational biology, and science in general.  Use of 
Linked Data facilitates the execution of semantic queries against all 
information contained within <nop>NeuroCommons data stores.  The <nop>Neurocommons 
AMI for EC2 is a pre-installed and pre-configured Virtuoso instance that 
provides a full copy of the <nop>NeuroCommons knowledgebase for quick and 
convenient personal research use.

---+++Tech Tricks & Tips - Data Migration Edition

<nop>OpenLink Support believes forewarned is forearmed, so we are sharing our 
best data migration and integration advisories.  Find more migration tips 
and tricks in our evolving "Data Integration & Migration Strategies" guide:

---++++Mind Your Own Bitness

"Bitness" or bit descriptor compatibility issues are a perennial problem 
with data migration and integration projects.  Many client applications and 
DBMSs are hosted on 64-bit operating systems.  Consequently, users assume 
a need for 64-bit data access drivers or providers.  This is not the case.

Data access products must share the same bit descriptor as the local client 
application and/or DBMS.  In many cases, 32-bit applications and DBMSs are 
running on the latest and greatest 64-bit machines.

To complicate matters....  It is not uncommon for 64-bit client applications 
and DBMSs to have 32-bit utilities -- or a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit 
utilities -- to perform data access tasks.  Familiarize yourself with your 
architecture before embarking on mission-critical data access undertakings.  
Consult <nop>OpenLink Product Support if you need assistance.


---++++Layers Upon Layers

Be wary of architectures that require a client application layer to sit 
on top of multiple data access layers that bridge to one another such as 
OLE DB to ODBC.  More layers introduce the potential for more compatibility 
problems and troubleshooting headaches.  Consult <nop>OpenLink Product Support 
for suggestions on architecture optimization.


---++++Data Type Dilemmas & Parse Problems

Don't be surprised if attempts to query one DBMS with another DBMS-related 
client application results in data type compatibility or SQL syntax errors.  
This is a harsh reality of system integration, and many of these cross-DBMS 
and cross-vendor interoperability nightmares can not be resolved.  Many 
vendors use lock-in as a market strategy, so their integration tools are an 
after-thought.  <nop>OpenLink Software's business model hinges on the production 
of open, standards-based products that ensure smooth interoperability 
during demanding integration tasks.  Consult <nop>OpenLink Product Support for 
additional information.


---++++Master Your Data Management With MDM

Say goodbye to yesterday's short-sighted and problem-prone data integration
projects.  Free yourself from limiting DBMS schemas and incompatible 
migration tools produced by competing DBMS vendors.  Forget rip-and-replace
solutions that strain or exceed budgets in today's cash-strapped world.  
Embrace the prospect of easy access to holistic and context based views of 
all your mission critical, heterogeneous data -- not just within the walls 
of your enterprise, but on the World Wide Web, as well.  <nop>OpenLink Virtuoso 
Universal Server is your Tool and the Entity-Attribute-Value model is your 
conceptual road map to true Master Data Management.  Contact <nop>OpenLink 
Software to learn more.
