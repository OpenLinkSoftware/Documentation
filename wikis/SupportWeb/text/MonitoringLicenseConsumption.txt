---++ Monitoring UDA License Usage, Releases 1.x to 5.x

---+++ Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier), Release 1.x to 5.x

Our Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) drivers can display basic information about database agent activity from which license usage can be inferred. 

The <b><code>oplshut</code></b> utility ships with all Request Broker binaries regardless of operating system. Either of the following commands will display the currently active client access sessions --
<verbatim>
oplshut -s
oplshut +show
</verbatim>
Each line item is associated with one database session, i.e., one "concurrent connection." The following illustration shows two <nowiki>PostgreSQL</nowiki> 7 (<code>pgr7</code>) sessions.

License usage can also be monitored through use of a database native session monitor or client-side ODBC tracing. Our support team can provide additional assistance with this, as needed.

---+++ Lite and Express Edition (Single-Tier), Release 1.x to 5.x

Lite and Express Edition drivers do not include a license monitoring utility previous to Release 6.x. License usage can be monitored through use of a database native session monitor or client-side ODBC tracing. Our support team can provide additional assistance with this, as needed.
