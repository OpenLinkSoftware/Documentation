The drivers on the MAC client got installed but they don't show up on
the iODBC Administrator/ODBC Drivers tab. (Mac OS 10.4.11) Is this
normal?

Leopard  - After removal of iodbc and openlink directories, I installed the 6.2 
software and created a user DSN.  When I clicked 'test' I got a popup 
window saying driver could not be loaded, and when I dismissed it, I got 
a second popup saying 'file not found'.
