---+Legacy Support & Deprecation Options

OpenLink Software stands behind each of the products in its product portfolio. The OpenLink Technical Services team will provide Web-based support for all of OpenLink's versions and releases. However, the team will prompt you to upgrade if compatibility, enhancement needs, or other issues are encountered in a product whose code base has been closed.

The current release is OpenLink 6.2. OpenLink's 1.x-5.x code bases are closed and the associated products are considered deprecated. Upgrade to 6.x will be necessary for product enhancements and compatibility issues, unless fee-based custom portation is arranged.
