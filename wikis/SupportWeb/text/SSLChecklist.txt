---++SSL Fact Sheet

As of version 5.2, <nop>OpenLink UDA now comes with optional support for using <nop>OpenSSL to encrypt the data layer between generic client and request broker / agent.

Features of the SSL implementation:

   * secures connections to both the broker and all database agents
   * encryption is optional, although it can be made mandatory
   * the same connection endpoint endpoint (port) handles both encrypted and non-encrypted clients
   * fully backward-compatible
   * per-agent certificates
   * all changes are in the <nop>OpenLink communications layer: there is no need to change any of the database agents to cater for SSL.
