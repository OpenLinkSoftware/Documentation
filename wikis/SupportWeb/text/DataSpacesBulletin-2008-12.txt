<p align="center"><b>December 2008</b></p>


Dear <nop>OpenLink Community,

Last month we launched the first edition of our 
[[DataSpacesMonthlySupportBulletin][monthly DataSpaces newsletter]].
This month, we've worked out some kinks and revamped the 
<nop>DataSpaces format.  We hope our revisions enhance your experience. 

November was a busy month at [[http://www.openlinksw.com/][OpenLink Software]].

We released Virtuoso Open Source Edition (VOS) 5.0.9, and introduced 
the Virtuoso Universal Server (Cloud Edition) for Amazon EC2. We also 
made it possible for you to instantiate your own [[http://dbpedia.org/][DBpedia]] instance in 
the Cloud. 

We have also collected pointers to a series of articles and resources 
that should help you resolve two of the more common issues users have 
encountered with our Universal Data Access products -- acquisition and 
deployment of licenses.

---++++ Introducing Virtuoso Universal Server (Cloud Edition) for Amazon EC2

Virtuoso Universal Server (Cloud Edition) is a pre-installed edition 
of Virtuoso for Amazon's EC2 Cloud platform. 

This packaging of our flagship Universal Server offers a boatload of 
features and benefits for Web entrepreneurs, DBAs, Systems Integrators, 
Developers, and anyone else ready to establish their presence on the 
Linked Data Web.

---++++ Get Your Own DBpedia in the Clouds

Yes, you too can have your very own instance of DBpedia 3.2 in the 
Cloud, thanks to Virtuoso and EC2. 

Simply instantiate your own Virtuoso EC2 AMI instance, install some 
special EC2 extensions (a few steps in the Conductor), and perform 
a "restore" from a backup of DBpedia in <nop>OpenLink's S3 bucket.

Voila! Your very own DBpedia in roughly one hour's time....

---++++ VOS 5.0.9 Now Available

VOS 5.0.9 focuses on performance optimizations for the SQL engine, 
SPARQL engine and ODBC and JDBC drivers, and fixes to the <nop>OpenLink 
Data Spaces (ODS) application suite. 

New features include: 
   * an Excel mime-type output option in the SPARQL endpoint; 
   * triple options <code>bif:contains</code> and transitivity; 
   * new RDF-generating cartridges for the Sponger; 
   * incorporation of UMBEL lookups into Sponger cartridges; 
   * support for very large HTTP client requests; 
   * a <code>sparql-auth</code> endpoint with digest authentication; 
   * initial support for the Ubiquity Firefox plugin. 

There are also bug fixes to memory leaks, SPARQL '<code>SELECT DISTINCT</code>' and 
various SQL query syntax handling; XHTML and <nop>JavaScript validation; 
and other UI fixes in the ODS application suite.

---+++Tech Tricks & Tips - UDA Licensing Edition
---

<nop>OpenLink Support has assembled a few pointers to license-related 
resources into our complete 
[[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/ProductLicensingGuide][Product Licensing Guide]].


---++++ Workstation Model Vs. Application Server Model

<nop>OpenLink has 
[[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/LicenseTerminology#OpenLink%20License%20Models][two licensing models]].

[[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/LicenseTerminology#Workstation%20Model][Workstation Model]] 
licenses apply to architectures where single-user 
client machines connect to a DBMS. 

[[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/LicenseTerminology#Application%20Server%20Model][Application Server Model]] 
licenses apply to architectures where 
each client machine is capable of supporting the DBMS connectivity 
needs of multiple end users at any given time.


---++++ When is a Workstation Not a Workstation

[[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/LicenseTerminology#Workstation][Workstations]] 
host Desktop or Personal Editions of common end-user 
operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.

Machines hosting server editions of Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux are 
not considered to be Workstations, even if the hardware is identical. 
Machines hosting server edition operating systems are considered to be 
[[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/LicenseTerminology#Application%20Server][Application Servers]].


---++++Count Your Cores

[[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/LicenseTerminology#Processor%20Cores][Physical processor core]] 
counts factor into <nop>OpenLink licensing.  Know ahead of time 
[[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/DetectCPU][how many physical processor cores exist]] 
in any machine that will host an <nop>OpenLink license. 


---++++ Don't Forget the <nop>OpenLink License Manager

Still experiencing "License expired" or "License not found" errors 
after installing a valid license file? Do not forget to restart the 
License Manager that ships with <nop>OpenLink 6.0 and newer drivers. 

The  License Manager 
[[http://support.openlinksw.com/supportweb/ApplyingLicenseFiles][needs to be restarted]] -- 
with the appropriate license variable set -- before a new license will be available for use.
