   1 Open a Finder window, and drill down to *Macintosh HD* -> *Library* -> *Application Support* -> *openlink* -> *bin*.%BR%%BR%
      1 In this directory, locate any existing file by the same name as your new license file.  Generally, this can simply be discarded, but you can keep it if you like; simply move it to a different location (such as your Desktop) or rename it (e.g., virtuoso.lic.2013-03-21.bak).  Once the new license is confirmed to work, it's usually best to discard the expired and/or unused license files, to avoid future confusion.%BR%%BR%
      1 Drag your new license file from your email or [[ODSBriefcaseLicenseStorage][ODS Briefcase]] to this directory, replacing any existing file by the same name.  %BR%%BR%
   1 Launch *Terminal.app* (found in <code><nowiki>/Applications/Utilities/</nowiki></code>).%BR%%BR%
   1 Execute these three commands (you can just copy-and-paste), and provide your Mac OS X user password when prompted --
<verbatim>
cd "/Library/Application Support/openlink/bin"
sudo ./oplmgr +stop
sudo ./oplmgr +start
</verbatim>
   1 Start Virtuoso as normal.%BR%%BR%
      1 If license errors are seen in the log file (<code>virtuoso.log</code>, by default), reboot, and test again.  %BR%%BR%
