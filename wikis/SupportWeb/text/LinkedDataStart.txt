---+++What is Linked Data?

Linked Data provides a methodology for exposing all forms of data using an RDF data model. This methodology also provides individual data objects with unique identifiers in the form of URIs, which enable the data to be accessed via HTTP. Data that is exposed in this manner has the advantage of retaining context which makes searches against the data more likely to return usable results. Data from heterogeneous data stores can be easily and meaningfully meshed with other data. And legacy or highly proprietary data can be easily integrated with open and standards-based applications. Thus, long-standing problems concerning the integration, migration, and querying of all types of internal, external, legacy, structured, and unstructured heterogeneous data can now be resolved. This is a significant advance over standard data access technologies currently in use.

---+++How does Linked Data benefit me or my enterprise?

Linked Data and associated technologies have numerous benefits for users and corporations. Linked Data provides an end to problematic data silos that arise when proprietary and/or legacy data stores can not be integrated with other, internal or external data sources.  Linked Data also provides a means to model and integrate all existing data using easy-to-adopt and open industry standards while preserving legacy investments and workflow. This means enterprises will not be subjected to dangerous vendor lock-in, nor will enterprises need to embark on cyclical, costly and inefficient rip-and-replace tactics to keep current with emerging technologies. Use of constituent Linked Data technologies such as personal URIs mean that private individuals have new means to integrate and manage blogs, wikis, and other Web resources they currently maintain. URIs also provide an end to the nightmare of managing identities on the Web, and they provide a means for ensuring that all of one's contributions to the Web can be tracked back to him or her.

---+++How do I get started with Linked Data?

<nop>OpenLink Software is committed to providing all customers and evaluators with the tools that they need to experience, learn about, and perform meaningful work with the Linked Data Web. A simple <nop>OpenLink registration provides:

   * <b><nop>OpenID</b> - This free and open standard eradicates the need for and hassle associated with maintaining multiple usernames and passwords for Web site access. <nop>OpenID is a decentralized identity system that provides one "digital identity" that you can use to login to any <nop>OpenID-enabled Web site. <nop>OpenID is "decentralized", because there is no one provider of the service. There are a multitude of <nop>OpenID identity providers who can provide you with this service. You simply register with such a provider and receive an <nop>OpenID in the form of a URL, which you can then use at a variety of locations such as <nop>MySpace, Yahoo!, AOL, and so on.  Additionally, you can associate personal details with your <nop>OpenID and control when and how those details are disseminated on the Web. 

   * <b>Linked Data Web ID (URI)</b> - URIs are unique identifiers that name an entity or resource and provide a means for locating that entity or resource somewhere on the Internet.  URIs are "dereferenced" when they are used to provide a representation of the entity or resource which they identify. Your personal URI identifies you as a unique "person" and provides a means for other users or agents to obtain information that you want to reveal about yourself. Information may include but is not limited to geographical location, birthday, professional associations, educational history, and so forth.  URIs are a convenient and ideal means to ensure that any Web contributions made by you are properly attributed back to you in an unambiguous manner. 

   * <b>Linked Data Web Profile Page</b> - Your personal URI identifies you as an entity who happens to be a "person". Your Linked Data Web Profile page provides you with a means to formally describe the person that you happen to  be. This is the location in which you would provide gender, birthday, professional, educational, and other information that you would like to share with other user and agents on the Web. 

   * <b>Unified Data Storage & Access Space</b> - Your Linked Data Storage & Access Space provides you with a single location in which you can store <nop>OpenLink license files and any other resources that you would like to expose on the Linked Data Web now or in the future. 

   * <b>Single Data Junction Box</b> - Your Data Junction Box serves as a huge in which you can establish a unified access point to Blogs, Wikis, Shared Bookmarks, Aggregated Feeds, and other Web resources maintained by you. Your Data Junction Box also enables you to mesh heterogeneous data contained in these various resources.

   * <b>Virtuoso Universal Server platform</b> - Virtuoso Universal Server is <nop>OpenLink Software's premier Linked Data Web (a.k.a. "Web 3.0" or "Semantic Web") platform, and it is the engine that underlies and serves up the resources cited above.
