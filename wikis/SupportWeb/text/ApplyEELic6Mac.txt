      1 In this directory, locate any existing file by the same name as your new license file.  Generally, this can simply be discarded, but you can keep it if you like; simply move it to a different location (such as your Desktop) or rename it (e.g., sql_lt.lic.2011-03-21.bak).  Once the new license is confirmed to work, it's usually best to discard the expired and/or unused license files, to avoid future confusion.%BR%%BR%
      1 Drag your new license file from your email or [[ODSBriefcaseLicenseStorage][ODS Briefcase]] to this directory, replacing any existing file by the same name.  %BR%%BR%

cd "/Library/Application Support/openlink/bin"
./oplmgr +stop
./oplmgr +start

      1 If you get an error, execute these two commands (again, you can just copy-and-paste), and provide your Mac OS X user password when prompted --
<verbatim>
sudo ./oplmgr +stop
sudo ./oplmgr +start
</verbatim>
   1 Test your connection with the OpenLink ODBC Administrator.app or any other ODBC client application.%BR%%BR%
