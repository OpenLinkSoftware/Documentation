---++++ Multi-Tier
    
  OpenLink's Multi-Tier drivers can display basic information about database agent activity from which license usage can be inferred. The oplshut utility ships with all Request Broker binaries regardless of operating system. oplshut can be run with the -s or +show flags to display the number of active database agents. Each ative agent is associated with one database session and one "concurrent connection." The following illustration shows two PostgreSQL agents (pgr7) connections.

    

    License usage can be monitored through use of a database native session monitor or clientside ODBC tracing. OpenLink Product Support can provide additional information, as needed.

    
---++++ Single-Tier
    
  OpenLink's early Single-Tier drivers do not provide a license monitoring utility. License usage can be monitored through use of a database native session monitor or clientside ODBC tracing. OpenLink Product Support can provide additional information, as needed.
