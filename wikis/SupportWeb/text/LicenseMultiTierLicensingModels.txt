---++ Multi-Tier Licensing Models
    
  
---+++ Client/Server
    
  OpenLink's traditional *Client/Server* license pertains to architectures wherein one or more client machines host SQL client applications that issue queries to a backend DBMS via OpenLink's Multi-Tier drivers. The SQL client application and client portion of the Multi-Tier driver must reside on the same machine. The Multi-Tier server components may reside on any machine on the network that contains the DBMS or DBMS native client, as shown below.

    Client machines tend to be Mac or Windows desktops. Applications tend to be spreadsheets, report building tools, or other end-user applications. Licenses are deployed on each machine that hosts the Multi-Tier server components. These licenses usually have a moderate pool of concurrent client hosts and connections to meet the immediate needs of end users who utilize the software.

    
---++++ Basic Client/Server
    
  One or more clients contain a SQL client application and OpenLink's Multi-Tier client driver. The server components are installed on the DBMS server.

    

    
---++++ Client/Server with Gateway
    
  One or more clients contain a SQL client application and OpenLink's Multi-Tier client driver. The Multi-Tier server components are installed on a gateway server that may or may not contain a database native client, depending on the target DBMS and the capabilities of the OpenLink Multi-Tier server components. No OpenLink software is installed on the DBMS server.

---++++ Single Machine Architecture
    
  A single client contains a SQL client application and OpenLink's Multi-Tier client driver. The Multi-Tier server components and DBMS are also installed this same machine.

    

    
---+++ Application Server
    
  OpenLink's Application Server license pertains to architectures wherein multiple, remote clients connect to a centralized server that hosts application server software that manages and serves remote clients by returning SQL data from a backend DBMS via OpenLink's Multi-Tier drivers. The application server software and client portion of the Multi-Tier drivers must reside on the same machine. This machine may or may not be a dedicated application server. The Multi-Tier server components may reside on any machine on the network that contains the DBMS or DBMS native client, as shown below.

    Application Server architectures tend to comprise software deployed on powerful, multi-core, Unix or Linux machines. Thread-safety, parallel execution, load balancing, and other features associated with high volume usage tend to be mission critical. The Application Server license is deployed on a single server with a single client host and usually contains a large or unlimited pool of connections to meet the needs of its many clients.

    
---++++ Dedicated Application Server
    
  Remote clients or dumb terminals connect to a dedicated application server that contains a SQL compliant client application and OpenLink's Multi-Tier client. The Multi-Tier server components reside on a distnct DBMS server.

    <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/licensingimages/MTASBasic.png" alt="Basic Multi-Tier Application Server Model">/Intermediate machines may extend the architecture, if the Multi-Tier server components are installed on a gateway machine that may or may not contain a database native client depending on the target DBMS and capabilities of the driver. /

    
---++++ Dedicated Application Server (Variant)
    
  Remote clients or dumb terminals connect to a dedicated application server that contains a SQL compliant client application and OpenLink's Multi-Tier client. The Multi-Tier server components also reside on the application server which may or may not contain a database native client, depending on the target DBMS and the capabilities of the OpenLink Multi-Tier server components. No OpenLink software is installed on the DBMS server.

    <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/licensingimages/MTASVariant.png" alt="Multi-Tier Application Server Mode (Variant)">
---++++ Dual-Purpose Application and DBMS Server
    
  Remote clients or dumb terminals connect to a dedicated application server that contains a SQL compliant client application, OpenLink's Multi-Tier client, OpenLink's Multi-Tier server components, and the DBMS.
