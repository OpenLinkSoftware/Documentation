---++++<nop>MusicBrainz EC2 EMI Released


<nop>Musicbrainz joins, DBpedia, and Bio2Rdf in EC2 cloud.

<nop>MusicBrainz is a comprehensive, community-oriented metadatabase. It 
contains information about artists, album titles, track titles, track 
lengths, and so forth. You can access information pertaining to music 
by browsing the <nop>MusicBrainz site, or you can access it using various 
client applications. Better still, you can instantiate your own 
<nop>MusicBrainz instance in the cloud!

---++++<nop>OpenLink Data Explorer Extension for Firefox, v0.25


ODEE is a browser-hosted client that uses REST-based "RDFizer" Proxy 
Services to produce RDF Linked Data from Web information resources. By 
default, ODEE is bound to a Virtuoso Sponger service provided and hosted 
by <nop>OpenLink Software. The Virtuoso Sponger is similar to an ODBC or JDBC 
Driver Manager, in that it connects client applications to one or more 
RDF Data Providers (also known as Sponger Cartridges).  More than 30 
such Cartridges are active on the <nop>OpenLink-hosted service, offering 
live, RDFized-on-the-fly versions of pages from Amazon, Bugzilla, eBay, 
Flickr, <nop>MusicBrainz, Yahoo! Finance, Twitter, and others, with still 
more on the way.

The very latest release of the <nop>OpenLink Data Explorer extension for 
Firefox is available at:

---++++Deploying Linked Data


This document describes the process of deploying Linked Data on the 
existing Web. It discusses some of the difficulties faced in exposing 
RDF data and in bridging the "Semantic Data-Web" and the traditional 
"Document Web."

---+++Tech Tricks & Tips - Little Bird Edition
---

Last month the team announced <nop>OpenLink Tech Tweets. If you have not had 
the opportunity to follow the ensuing high-tech tweet-fest, I'll happily 
share what a  "little bird" told me....
   

---++++DBpedia ++


Did you know that DBpedia is powered by Virtuoso 5.0? This joint project 
offered up by <nop>OpenLink Software and two German universities has until 
recently served as the most notable front-end interface to a federated, 
Web-based OODBMS.  <nop>OpenLink Software has now launched a veritable 
DBpedia++. LOD is billed as the bigger brother to DBpedia. LOD contains 
DBpedia, Freebase, <nop>MusicBrainz, Uniprot, Bio2Rdf, dbtune, <nop>NeuroCommons, 
<nop>PingTheSemanticWeb, and more. Add Yago, UMBEL, <nop>OpenCyc and reasoning to 
the LOD equation, and th quality of your search results and data meshes 
increases exponentially.

---++++WebID


<nop>OpenLink Virtuoso now provides a solution to trust and privacy issues 
surrounding Linked Data. Virtuoso's new WebID support uses SPARQL-
based modifications to SSL to provide Identity-based, platform 
independent security. WebID solves innumerable headaches such as 
centralized certificate management, and it promotes the development 
of such things as  highly granular, policy based security. Learn how 
WebID can identity challenges can stop the nuisance of spam, 
malicious commentary, and much, much more.

---++++Entity Ranking


Entity Ranking joins Faceted Browsing as a Virtuoso 6.0 deliverable. 
Entity Ranking is a visual aid that promotes identification of highly-
relevant search results. It is the Linked Data Web equivalent of Page 
Rank, but it is all the more powerful, because it uses a link coefficient 
algorithm fueled by the relationships between the entities in the linked 
data search.

---++++ODS-Briefcases & Amazon S3 Buckets

<nop>OpenLink has realized the final piece of its Unified Storage story. 
Amazon S3 buckets now join <nop>WebDav and SQL data as resources transparently 
integrated into -- and exposed by -- <nop>OpenLink ODS-Briefcases. S3 buckets, 
<nop>WebDav, and SQL are all now accessible using any of several different views: 
OS filesystem tree, RDF graph, or relational table tuples.
