---++ How Do I Monitor Open Database Sessions Associated With DB2 ODBC Connections

You can use the Event Monitors feature that is present in the DB2 System Monitor. The Event Monitors feature allows you to create and activate a monitor that logs  for one or more of each of the following events:

   * Deadlocks
   * Statements
   * Transactions
   * Connections
   * Database
   * Buffer pools
   * Table spaces
   * Tables Read or Written

These monitors may be created and activated using the following syntax:

<verbatim>
db2 connect to <database>
db2 "create event monitor <monitor name> for <event(s)> write to file 'filename'"
mkdir <directory for event file>
db2 "set event monitor <monitor name> state 1"
</verbatim>

For example

*Unix*
<verbatim>
db2 connect to sample
db2 "create event monitor connmon for connections write to file '/tmp/connections/connmon.log'"
mkdir /tmp/connections
db2 "set event monitor connmon state 1"
</verbatim>


*Windows*
<verbatim>
db2 connect to sample
db2 "create event monitor connmon for connections write to file 'C:\Temp\connections\connmon.log'"
mkdir C:\Temp\connections
db2 "set event monitor connmon state 1"
</verbatim>

Use db2evmon -path <path to filename> to format and display the contents of the log. For example:

*Unix*
<verbatim>
db2evmon -path /tmp/connections/connmon.log
</verbatim>

*Windows*
<verbatim>
db2evmon -path C:\Temp\connections\connmon.log
</verbatim>

Finally, deactivate event monitors by setting the state to 0. For example:


<verbatim>
db2 connect to sample
db2 "set event monitor connmon state 0"
</verbatim>
