<bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h3"> Client/Server</bridgehead>
<para>  <ulink url="OpenLink">OpenLink</ulink>&#39;s *Client/Server* license pertains to architectures in which individual   *client         hosts* contain SQL- or HTTP-based data consuming applications.
 Each application instance supports the needs of one user on a given  <emphasis>client host</emphasis> .Client machines tend to be Mac or Windows desktops.
 Applications tend to be spreadsheets, report building tools, or other end-user applications.
 Licenses are deployed on the Virtuoso server machine.
 These licenses usually have a moderate pool of concurrent users and connections to meet the immediate needs of end users who utilize the software.</para>

<bridgehead class="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml:h3"> Application Server</bridgehead>
<para>  <ulink url="OpenLink">OpenLink</ulink>&#39;s Application Server license pertains to architectures in which a single client host contains SQL- or HTTP-based data consuming applications.
 This single, centralized application instance supports the needs of multiple end users who connect to the client host from remote terminals or workstations.</para>
<para>    Application Server architectures tend to comprise Application Server software deployed on powerful, multi-core, Unix or Linux machines.
 Thread-safety, parallel execution, load balancing, fail-safety, and other features associated with one or more application instances for resilient, high volume, mission critical computing are the key characteristics of this model.
 The Application Server license(s) can be deployed on a single Virtuoso server or server cluster and usually contains a large or unlimited pool of connections to meet the needs of its many end users.</para>
