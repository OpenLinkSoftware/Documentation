 Users are identified by the hostname or IP address of the machine which hosts their target application(s).
 <figure><graphic fileref="ADONETLogicalDiagrams/ApplicationInstance.png" /></figure> The application instance refers to individual instances of applications that users exploit in the target architecture.
 Each instance of the application(s) is tasked with returning SQL data to users in a manner that is meaningful to them.
 <figure><graphic fileref="ADONETLogicalDiagrams/OpenLinkProvider.png" /></figure> The OpenLink Client Provider refers to OpenLink&#39;s ADO .NET Provider.
 <figure><graphic fileref="ADONETLogicalDiagrams/DriverManager.png" /></figure> The driver manager is a generic utility that loads drivers when requested to do so by client applications.
 OpenLink&#39;s Windows-based drivers are compatible with the Microsoft Driver Manager.
 OpenLink&#39;s Mac and Unix drivers ship with the iODBC Driver Manager.
 However, these drivers are designed for interoperability with non-OpenLink driver managers such as unixODBC and Intersolv.
 <figure><graphic fileref="ADONETLogicalDiagrams/OpenLinkClient.png" /></figure> The OpenLink client driver comprises a clientside-only install of a .dll or other library and supporting files.
 Single-Tier Client Drivers are DBMS- or Bridge-specific.
 They establish ODBC connectivity without the assistance of server components.
 Multi-Tier ODBC Client Drivers are generic.
 They require OpenLink Server Components to complete any data requests.
 <figure><graphic fileref="ADONETLogicalDiagrams/DatabaseClient.png" /></figure> Database native client refers to third-party database client communications software that facilitates connectivity to the target data store.
 This software speaks the native protocol of that data store.
 <figure><graphic fileref="ADONETLogicalDiagrams/ThirdPartySource.png" /></figure> ODBC DSN or JDBC URL refers to ODBC Data Sources or JDBC Connection URLs that pre-exist on the client system.
 These DSNs or JDBC URLS often use 3rd-party data access products, but they may use OpenLink UDA as well.
 <figure><graphic fileref="ADONETLogicalDiagrams/OpenLinkServer.png" /></figure> The OpenLink server components  are architectural components that are specific to the Multi-Tier product format.
 The server components consist of a Request Broker and an Agent.
 The Request Broker is a generic, TCP-based listening  service.
 It responds to client driver requests and loads the Agent that is suited for fulling those client requests.
 Agents may be DBMS- or bridge- specific.
 Requets for Oracle data would be satisfied by one of OpenLink&#39;s Oracle Database Agents.
 Requests for data contained in a JDBC  data store would be satisfied by one of OpenLink&#39;s bridge-based JDBC  agents.
 <figure><graphic fileref="ADONETLogicalDiagrams/Data.png" /></figure> Data refers to SQL data that is contained in the target data repository or repositories.
 <figure><graphic fileref="ADONETLogicalDiagrams/SharedMemory.png" /></figure> Local IPC communications between architectural components.
 Local IPC communications can only occur when architectural components are hosted on the same, physical machine.
 <figure><graphic fileref="ADONETLogicalDiagrams/TCP.png" /></figure> TCP/IP-based communications between architectural components.
 TCP/IP-based communications can occur across machine boundaries.
