<html><body><div class="topic-text"><p>The drivers on the MAC client got installed but they don&#39;t show up on the iODBC Administrator/ODBC Drivers tab.
 (Mac OS 10.4.11) Is this normal?</p>
<p>Leopard  - After removal of iodbc and openlink directories, I installed the 6.2 software and created a user DSN.
 When I clicked &#39;test&#39; I got a popup window saying driver could not be loaded, and when I dismissed it, I got a second popup saying &#39;file not found&#39;.
