<h2><a name="Supported Architectures - Multi-Tier Drivers"></a> Supported Architectures - Multi-Tier Drivers</h2>
<nop></nop><p>OpenLink&#39;s <nop></nop>MySQL, <nop></nop>PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Sybase database agents are wire protocol enabled.
 These Multi-Tier drivers support the following, JDBC data access architectures.
 The Workstation and Application Server designations specify the appropriate license to deploy in a given situation.
 Workstation licenses apply to architectures in which one user connects to an application instance at one time.
 Application Server licenses apply to architectures in which multiple users connect to an application instance at one time.</p>

<img src="MTWireJDBCDiagrams/MTWireJDBCArch2.png" alt="Client, Server and Gateway"><hr> <img src="MTWireJDBCDiagrams/User.png" alt="User"> Users are humans or non-human agents that leverage applications to obtain or manipulate SQL data held in data repositories.
 Users are identified by the hostname or IP address of the machine which hosts their target application(s).
 Users appearing inside bounding box of client machine represent local users and support a client/server architecture.
 Users appearing outside bounding box represent remote users and indicate an application server model.
<hr> <img src="MTWireJDBCDiagrams/ApplicationInstance.png" alt="Application Instance"> The application instance refers to individual instances of applications that users exploit in the target architecture.
 Each instance of the application(s) is tasked with returning SQL data to users in a manner that is meaningful to them.
<hr> <img src="MTWireJDBCDiagrams/DriverManager.png" alt="Driver Manager"> The driver manager is a generic utility that loads drivers when requested to do so by client applications.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Windows-based drivers are compatible with the Microsoft Driver Manager.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Mac and Unix drivers ship with the iODBC Driver Manager.
 However, these drivers are designed for interoperability with non-<nop></nop>OpenLink driver managers such as unixODBC and Intersolv.
<hr> <img src="MTWireJDBCDiagrams/OpenLinkClient.png" alt="OpenLink ODBC Client Driver"> The <nop></nop>OpenLink client driver comprises a clientside-only install of a .dll or other library and supporting files.
 Single-Tier client drivers are DBMS- or bridge-specific.
 They establish ODBC connectivity without the assistance of server components.
 Multi-Tier ODBC client drivers are generic.
 They require <nop></nop>OpenLink server components to complete any data requests.
<hr> <img src="MTWireJDBCDiagrams/DatabaseClient.png" alt="OpenLink ODBC Client Driver"> Database native client refers to third-party database client communications software that facilitates connectivity to the target data store.
 This software speaks the native protocol of that data store.
<hr> <img src="MTWireJDBCDiagrams/ThirdPartySource.png" alt="ODBC DSN or JDBC URL"> ODBC DSN or JDBC URL refers to ODBC data sources or JDBC connection URLs that pre-exist on the client system.
 These DSNs or JDBC URLS often use 3rd-party data access products, but they may use <nop></nop>OpenLink data access drivers as well.
 The drivers used to create the DSN or JDBC connection URL must share the same bit descriptor as the <nop></nop>OpenLink server components.
<hr> <img src="MTWireJDBCDiagrams/OpenLinkServer.png" alt="OpenLink Server Components"> The <nop></nop>OpenLink server components  are architectural components that are specific to the Multi-Tier product format.
 The server components consist of a Request Broker and an Agent.
 The Request Broker is a generic, TCP-based listening  service.
 It responds to client driver requests and loads the Agent that is suited for fulling those client requests.
 Agents may be DBMS- or bridge- specific.
 Requests for Oracle data are satisfied by one of <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Oracle Database Agents.
 Requests for data contained in a JDBC  data store are satisfied by one of <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s bridge-based JDBC  agents.
<hr> <img src="MTWireJDBCDiagrams/Data.png" alt="Data"> Data refers to SQL data that is contained in the target data store.
<hr> <img src="MTWireJDBCDiagrams/SharedMemory.png" alt="Local IPC Connection"> Local IPC communications between architectural components.
 Local IPC communications can only occur when architectural components are hosted on the same, physical machine.
<hr> <img src="MTWireJDBCDiagrams/TCP.png" alt="TCP/IP Connection"> TCP/IP-based communications between architectural components.
 TCP/IP-based communications can occur across machine boundaries.
