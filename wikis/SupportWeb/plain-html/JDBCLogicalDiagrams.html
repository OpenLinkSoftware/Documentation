 Users are identified by the hostname or IP address of the machine which hosts their target application(s).
<hr> <img src="JDBCLogicalDiagrams/ApplicationInstance.png" alt="Application Instance"> The application instance refers to individual instances of applications that users exploit in the target architecture.
 Each instance of the application(s) is tasked with returning SQL data to users in a manner that is meaningful to them.
<hr> <img src="JDBCLogicalDiagrams/DriverManager.png" alt="Driver Manager"> The driver manager is a generic utility that loads drivers when requested to do so by client applications.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Windows-based drivers are compatible with the Microsoft Driver Manager.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Mac and Unix drivers ship with the iODBC Driver Manager.
 However, these drivers are designed for interoperability with non-<nop></nop>OpenLink driver managers such as unixODBC and Intersolv.
<hr> <img src="JDBCLogicalDiagrams/OpenLinkClient.png" alt="OpenLink ODBC Client Driver"> The <nop></nop>OpenLink client driver comprises a clientside-only install of a .dll or other library and supporting files.
 Single-Tier client drivers are DBMS- or bridge-specific.
 They establish ODBC connectivity without the assistance of server components.
 Multi-Tier ODBC client drivers are generic.
 They require <nop></nop>OpenLink server components to complete any data requests.
<hr> <img src="JDBCLogicalDiagrams/DatabaseClient.png" alt="OpenLink ODBC Client Driver"> Database native client refers to third-party database client communications software that facilitates connectivity to the target data store.
 This software speaks the native protocol of that data store.
<hr> <img src="JDBCLogicalDiagrams/ThirdPartySource.png" alt="ODBC DSN or JDBC URL"> ODBC DSN or JDBC URL refers to ODBC data sources or JDBC connection URLs that pre-exist on the client system.
 These DSNs or JDBC URLS often use 3rd-party data access products, but they may use <nop></nop>OpenLink data access drivers as well.
 The drivers used to create the DSN or JDBC connection URL must share the same bit descriptor as the <nop></nop>OpenLink server components.
<hr> <img src="JDBCLogicalDiagrams/OpenLinkServer.png" alt="OpenLink Server Components"> The <nop></nop>OpenLink server components  are architectural components that are specific to the Multi-Tier product format.
 The server components consist of a Request Broker and an Agent.
 The Request Broker is a generic, TCP-based listening  service.
 It responds to client driver requests and loads the Agent that is suited for fulling those client requests.
 Agents may be DBMS- or bridge- specific.
 Requests for Oracle data are satisfied by one of <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Oracle Database Agents.
 Requests for data contained in a JDBC  data store are satisfied by one of <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s bridge-based JDBC  agents.
<hr> <img src="JDBCLogicalDiagrams/Data.png" alt="Data"> Data refers to SQL data that is contained in the target data store.
<hr> <img src="JDBCLogicalDiagrams/SharedMemory.png" alt="Local IPC Connection"> Local IPC communications between architectural components.
 Local IPC communications can only occur when architectural components are hosted on the same, physical machine.
<hr> <img src="JDBCLogicalDiagrams/TCP.png" alt="TCP/IP Connection"> TCP/IP-based communications between architectural components.
 TCP/IP-based communications can occur across machine boundaries.
