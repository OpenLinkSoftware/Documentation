<p align="center">A monthly newsletter dedicated to the promotion of best practices  and education in the data access and integration communities.</p><p align="center">Brought to you by the team at <nop></nop>OpenLink Software</p><p align="center">January 2009</p><p>Dear <nop></nop>OpenLink Community,</p>
<p>Happy New Year from everyone at <nop></nop>OpenLink Software!</p>
<p>In the spirit of the new year, <nop></nop>OpenLink is stocking its product portfolio with new offerings, introducing new approaches to old data integration hurdles, and challenging traditional concepts of data and computing with a paradigm shift that puts virtualized, multi-model DBMSs front and center.
Strictly relational data access is a thing of the past.
 Powerful, context-based queries based on the Entity-Attribute-Value model are the way of the future, and <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s Virtuoso Universal Server is the tool that will get us there.</p>
<p>Not ready for a paradigm shift? The team has put together a set of practical tips and tricks to assist you with your immediate migration and integration needs.
 Got trouble interfacing data in different DBMSs from different vendors? <nop></nop>OpenLink has got you covered.</p>

<p> </p>
<h4><a name="Mind Your Own Bitness"></a>Mind Your Own Bitness</h4>
<p>&quot;Bitness&quot; or bit descriptor compatibility issues are a perennial problem with data migration and integration projects.
 Many client applications and DBMSs are hosted on 64-bit operating systems.
 Consequently, users assume a need for 64-bit data access drivers or providers.
 This is not the case.</p>
<p>Data access products must share the same bit descriptor as the local client application and/or DBMS.
 In many cases, 32-bit applications and DBMSs are running on the latest and greatest 64-bit machines.</p>
<p>To complicate matters....
 It is not uncommon for 64-bit client applications and DBMSs to have 32-bit utilities -- or a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit utilities -- to perform data access tasks.
 Familiarize yourself with your architecture before embarking on mission-critical data access undertakings.
Consult <nop></nop>OpenLink Product Support if you need assistance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a name="Layers Upon Layers"></a>Layers Upon Layers</h4>
<p>Be wary of architectures that require a client application layer to sit on top of multiple data access layers that bridge to one another such as OLE DB to ODBC.
 More layers introduce the potential for more compatibility problems and troubleshooting headaches.
 Consult <nop></nop>OpenLink Product Support for suggestions on architecture optimization.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a name="Data Type Dilemmas &amp; Parse Problems"></a>Data Type Dilemmas &amp; Parse Problems</h4>
<p>Don&#39;t be surprised if attempts to query one DBMS with another DBMS-related client application results in data type compatibility or SQL syntax errors.
This is a harsh reality of system integration, and many of these cross-DBMS and cross-vendor interoperability nightmares can not be resolved.
 Many vendors use lock-in as a market strategy, so their integration tools are an after-thought.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink Software&#39;s business model hinges on the production of open, standards-based products that ensure smooth interoperability during demanding integration tasks.
 Consult <nop></nop>OpenLink Product Support for additional information.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a name="Master Your Data Management With MDM"></a>Master Your Data Management With MDM</h4>
<p>Say goodbye to yesterday&#39;s short-sighted and problem-prone data integration projects.
 Free yourself from limiting DBMS schemas and incompatible migration tools produced by competing DBMS vendors.
 Forget rip-and-replace solutions that strain or exceed budgets in today&#39;s cash-strapped world.
Embrace the prospect of easy access to holistic and context based views of all your mission critical, heterogeneous data -- not just within the walls of your enterprise, but on the World Wide Web, as well.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink Virtuoso Universal Server is your Tool and the Entity-Attribute-Value model is your conceptual road map to true Master Data Management.
