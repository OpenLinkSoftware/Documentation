<p>Our Enterprise Edition (Multi-Tier) drivers support the following data access architectures.
 The Workstation and Application Server designations describe usage models.
 Workstation usage apply to architectures in which one user connects to an application instance at one time.
 Application Server licenses apply to architectures in which multiple users connect to an application instance at one time.</p>
