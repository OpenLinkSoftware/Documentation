<h3><a name="Are you currently building new drivers for Mac OS 9?"></a> Are you currently building new drivers for Mac OS 9?</h3>
<p>Our support for Mac OS 9/Classic is being phased out due to its EOL status with Apple, and its inherent inability to support some key features of our drivers.
 Currently, no Release 6.x Data Access components exist for this platform, and none are planned.</p>
<h2><a name="Lion (Mac OS X 10.7.x), Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8.x), Mavericks (OS X 10.9.x), and Yosemite (OS X 10.10.x) Support"></a> Lion (Mac OS X 10.7.x), Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8.x), Mavericks (OS X 10.9.x), and Yosemite (OS X 10.10.x) Support</h2>
<h3><a name="Which builds should I use?"></a> Which builds should I use?</h3>
<p>To date, all Release 6.3 components built for Leopard have tested fully compatible with these later versions of Mac OS X.
 Earlier builds for Leopard may also be compatible with later OS versions, but we recommend always using the latest available download.</p>
<h2><a name="Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5.x) and Snow Leopard (Mac OS X 10.6.x) Support"></a> Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5.x) and Snow Leopard (Mac OS X 10.6.x) Support</h2>
<h3><a name="Are your Release 5.2 Leopard-compatible builds compatible with PPC and/or Intel?"></a> Are your Release 5.2 Leopard-compatible builds compatible with PPC and/or Intel?</h3>
<p>Our Release 5.x components are not, and will not be, available in Universal nor Intel binary builds, and thus cannot be used by Intel-native client applications.
 They can only be used with PPC-native or Rosetta-launched Universal builds on Intel Macs.
 Upgrade Lite or Enterprise Edition drivers to Release 6.x to obtain full Intel compatibility.</p>
<h3><a name="Are your Express Edition drivers compatible with Mac Intel client systems?"></a> Are your Express Edition drivers compatible with Mac Intel client systems?</h3>
<p>Yes.
 Our Express Edition drivers support Intel and Universal Binary applications that run on any Intel Mac.</p>
<p>However, PPC-native Binary applications (such as Microsoft Query, as shipped with Microsoft Office:Mac v.X through Office:Mac 2008; Office 2011 and later include an Intel-native Query) cannot use Express Edition drivers on Intel-based Macs; this is due to Apple&#39;s decision to install only Intel-native JVM components, rather than a Universal binary JVM, on these Macs.
 PPC-native binaries can only use Lite or Enterprise Edition drivers on Intel-based Macs.</p>

<p>Did you drag the installer .mpkg from the mounted .dmg and onto your hard disk? There are a number of limitations in the Mac OS X Installer.app.
 Therefore, we do not recommend this practice.
Please mount the downloaded .dmg, and simply double-click the .mpkg contained within.</p>

<p>Yes.
 These clients will coexist happily.
 Please always use a Generic Client from the same Release as your target Request Broker -- i.e., Release 5.x Generic Client against Release 5.x Broker/Agent.
 Using a mix of components (e.g., a Release 6.x Generic Client against a Release 5.x Broker/Agent, or a Release 5.x Generic Client against a Release 6.x Broker/Agent) may not produce any error messages, but such combinations are untested and unsupported, and may lead to unexpected and undesired results.</p>
<h2><a name="Licensing"></a> Licensing</h2>
<h3><a name="What is the source of &quot;no valid license found&quot; errors?"></a> What is the source of &quot;no valid license found&quot; errors?</h3>
<p>This error message has 3 predominant causes:</p>
<ul><li>The license file is not in /Library/Application Support/OpenLink/bin </li>
<li>It is not named correctly </li>
<li>It has been corrupted</li>
</ul><h3><a name="What causes an error like &quot;Your license is not valid on a 4 processors architecture&quot;?"></a> What causes an error like &quot;Your license is not valid on a 4 processors architecture&quot;?</h3>
<p>Your machine has 4 processor cores, as either one quad-core processor or two dual-core processors.
 OpenLink licenses by the core, so you need to obtain a larger license.</p>

<p>The application&#39;s <code>$ODBCINI</code> setting should target your System-level <code>/Library/ODBC/odbc.ini</code>.
 Locate the problem dependency in the application&#39;s native configuration file.
 For example: </p>
<br><pre>ODBCINI=/private/var/root/Library/Preferences/ODBC.preference
</pre><p>Change the variable to read: </p>
<br><pre>ODBCINI=/Library/ODBC/odbc.ini
</pre><p>You may need to reboot to make this all take effect, depending on how that client application is written.</p>

<h3><a name="DB2"></a> DB2</h3>
<h4><a name="Do your Express Edition drivers connect to DB2 hosted on iSeries?"></a> Do your Express Edition drivers connect to DB2 hosted on iSeries?</h4>
<p>Experience suggests that our Single-Tier Express Edition Driver for DB2 for Mac OS X may be used successfully against some iSeries-hosted DB2 instances.
 This is not the case in all situations.
 Use of our Lite Edition ODBC Driver for JDBC Data Sources with the JT400 package is more likely to succeed due to differences in the way DB2 on AS/400 communicates vs DB2 on Windows/Linux.
 We generally have success in using our current Express Edition against AS/400, but there are some environments where this does not work, and thus the JT400 package is necessary.</p>
<p>If you would like to test with the JT400 package, do the following: </p>
<ol><li>Obtain JT400.zip.
</li>
<li>Unzip JT400.zip.
</li>
<li>Locate the jt400.jar in the lib subdirectory.
</li>
<li>Put this jar file into your Mac&#39;s <code>/Library/Java/Extensions/</code> directory.
</li>
<li>Download and install our Lite Edition ODBC Driver for JDBC Data Sources.
</li>
<li>Configure an OpenLink DSN.
</li>
<li>Pass the following   Driver Classname in your DSN: <br><pre><br>com.ibm.as400.access.AS400JDBCDriver
</pre><br></li>
<li>Build the JDBC URL using the documented syntax.
 The following example URL specifies a connection to the database on system mysystem.helloworld.com with mylibrary as the default schema.
 The connection will use the system naming convention and return full error messages: <br><pre><br>jdbc:as400://mysystem.helloworld.com/mylibrary;naming=system;errors=full

<h4><a name="Why can't I use your Lite Edition drivers to connect my Mac Intel-native applications to Oracle?"></a> Why can&#39;t I use your Lite Edition drivers to connect my Mac Intel-native applications to Oracle?</h4>
<p>The OpenLink &quot;Lite&quot; Edition Driver for Oracle relies upon Oracle-supplied OCI Libraries, which have not been delivered for Intel-based Macs.
 You can only use Express Edition drivers on an Intel-based Mac, if your client application is PPC-native or is Universal and set to <a href="http://wikis.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/SupportWeb/OpenMacIntelAppsinRosetta" class="wikiword">&quot;Open in Rosetta&quot;</a> Intel-native applications.
 By default, Universal applications running normally will launch the Intel-native portion of the Universal driver, which will then try to load an Intel-native OCI library -- which is not available at the time of writing.</p>

<h4><a name="Why does FMPro produce &quot;Server Handle&quot; errors when used with Express drivers?"></a> Why does FMPro produce &quot;Server Handle&quot; errors when used with Express drivers?</h4>
FileMaker can not connect to OpenLink&#39;s Express Edition drivers using the CFM library due to compatibility issues with the JVM.
 This is an architectural dependency that cannot be changed.
 Consider use of our Multi-Tier or &quot;Lite&quot; Edition Single-Tier drivers.<h4><a name="How can I use FMPro to perform calculations and update remote data without an update?"></a> How can I use FMPro to perform calculations and update remote data without an update?</h4>

<h3><a name="Omnis"></a> Omnis</h3>
<h4><a name="Why does Omnis crash when used with your drivers?"></a> Why does Omnis crash when used with your drivers?</h4>
<p>This error occurs due to sub-optimal library linkage in Omnis Studio.
 Omnis library linkage is not dynamic.
 Even thought it is compatible with newer versions of the iODBC driver manager frameworks, it is hard-linked to one, specific version.
 OpenLink will introduce an iODBC driver manager enhancement to work around this limitation.
 In the interim, <a href="http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp" class="absuri">OpenLink Product Support</a> can assist you with the creation of soft-links that will resolve the immediate problem.</p>

<h4><a name="Why does Excel produce &quot;Unable to allocate server handle&quot; errors?"></a> Why does Excel produce &quot;Unable to allocate server handle&quot; errors?</h4>
<p>Are you running Excel on an Intel-based Mac along with our ODBC Driver for JDBC Data Sources or our Express Edition drivers? Our JDBC-related drivers cannot be used by PPC-native applications (such as MS Excel/Query v.X through 2008) on Intel Macs, due to limitations in Apple&#39;s JVM.</p>
<p>The PPC-native application will load the PPC-native segment of the iODBC Driver Manager, and in turn, the PPC-native segment of the ODBC driver -- but there is no PPC-native segment of the JVM.
 It only installs with Intel-native binaries on Intel-based Macs.</p>

<h4><a name="Why doesn't Query list all the tables in the target data source?"></a> Why doesn&#39;t Query list all the tables in the target data source?</h4>
<p>Microsoft Query issues the <code>SQLTables()</code> ODBC API call.
 This API call takes several arguments:  <code>TABLE</code>, <code>VIEW</code>, <code>SYNONYM</code>, etc.
 Microsoft Query only asks for <code>TABLE</code>; our ODBC driver therefore correctly leaves out the <code>VIEW</code>s and other table types.</p>
<p>We have introduced an enhancement into our driver to work around this issue.
 That said, you can manually create any query you like; the limitation only affects the graphical query builder.</p>

<p>The Data Source Name should use the IP address of the Windows instance.
 The Windows instance should get its own IP address -- distinct from the Mac&#39;s IP address -- via DHCP, hardcoding, etc.</p>

AugSoft&#39;s &quot;iODBCNet&quot; installation can cause significant problems with the iODBC infrastructure on the Mac.
 They create files in locations they should not, change settings they should not touch, and over-write libraries with outdated versions of the same.
 If you are not actively using the iODBCNet components at this time, consider removal.
 If you must use the iODBCNet software, <a href="http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp" class="absuri">consult OpenLink Product Support</a>.<h2><a name="Diagnostics"></a> Diagnostics</h2>

<p>Use the `iODBC Test.command` (/Applications/iODBC/) to test a DSN.
 When it launches, you&#39;ll see the iODBC version.
 You  will also receive a list of DSNs available for use.
 Enter a connect string of the following form -- </p>
<br><pre>DSN=&lt;dsn&gt;[;UID=&lt;username&gt;[;PWD=&lt;password&gt;]]
</pre><p>-- e.g., -- </p>

<p>This error could occur if you have a combination of Universal and PowerPC software on the Mac OS X host.
 Resolution would consist of removal of all OpenLink components and re-installation with guidance from <a href="http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp" class="absuri">OpenLink Product Support</a>.
 The <code>file</code> command can be used to verify whether or not particular components are Universal or PPC-based.
