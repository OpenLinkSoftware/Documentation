<nop></nop><p>PowerPC software cannot run directly on Intel hardware.</p>
<p>To ease the hardware transition, Apple built a <nop></nop>PowerPC emulator called Rosetta into the Intel version of Mac OS X &quot;Tiger&quot; (10.4.x) through &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; (10.6.x).
 It was discontinued as of Mac OS X &quot;Lion&quot; (10.7.x).</p>
<p>Rosetta works transparently, meaning whenever you launch a <nop></nop>PowerPC-native application, it will be automatically run through the Rosetta emulator.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Intel-native applications cannot use Rosetta to load <nop></nop>PowerPC-native plug-ins, drivers, or similar.</p>
<p>However, <nop></nop>PowerPC-native applications, running through Rosetta, <b>are</b> able to load <nop></nop>PowerPC-native plug-ins, drivers, etc.</p>
<p>Universal Binary applications, which typically include both <nop></nop>PowerPC-native and Intel-native executables, can be set to &quot;Open using Rosetta&quot; -- meaning, they will run as <nop></nop>PowerPC-native instead of the usually preferred Intel-native.</p>
<p>To enable this functionality, simply select the application and press Command-I, or select <b>Get Info</b> from the <b>File</b> menu.
 The Get Info dialog includes a checkbox labeled &quot;Open using Rosetta.&quot; Tick the box, and close the window.
 From now on, whenever the application is launched, it will open in <nop></nop>PowerPC mode, and <nop></nop>PowerPC-native plug-ins, drivers, etc., will be available to it.</p>
<p>It is best to upgrade all components to Intel-native, because <nop></nop>PowerPC-native applications running through Rosetta will run about 30% more slowly than Intel-native applications running on the same hardware.</p>
