#Retrieve your new OpenLink license file (e.g., sql_lt.lic, oplrqb.lic) from email or [[ODSBriefcaseLicenseStorage|ODS briefcase]] .  
#Place the new license file in the appropriate directory. 
*By default this is **C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\UDA\bin ** , but you may have installed elsewhere.  
*If in doubt, check all System and User Environment Variables ( **System ** control panel >> **Advanced ** tab >> **Environment Variables ** ) for an OPL_LICENSE_DIR.  
*If a license file by the same name is already present in this directory, rename the old file and save it until you're sure the new one works.   
#Launch the **Services ** or **Component Services ** utility ( **Start ** menu >> **Control Panel ** >> **Administrative Tools ** ).  
#Stop the **[[OpenLink|OpenLink]] Request Broker ** service.  
#Stop and restart the **OpenLink License Manager ** service.
