  Apply Release 6.x Express Edition License Files on Mac OS X 
#****Note: ** You must be logged in as a user with Administrator privileges. **   
#For best results, quit all ODBC client applications and administrative tools to start this process, and do not relaunch any of them until instructed to test your connection.  
#Locate your new license file in your email or [[ODSBriefcaseLicenseStorage|ODS Briefcase]] , and note its name.  
#Open a Finder window, and drill down to **Macintosh HD ** -> **Library ** -> **Application Support ** -> **openlink ** -> **bin ** . 
#In this directory, locate any existing file by the same name as your new license file. Generally, this can simply be discarded, but you can keep it if you like; simply move it to a different location (such as your Desktop) or rename it (e.g., sql_lt.lic.2011-03-21.bak). Once the new license is confirmed to work, it's usually best to discard the expired and/or unused license files, to avoid future confusion.  
#Drag your new license file from your email or [[ODSBriefcaseLicenseStorage|ODS Briefcase]] to this directory, replacing any existing file by the same name.   
#Launch **Terminal.app ** (found in /Applications/Utilities/). 
#Execute these three commands (you can just copy-and-paste) -- 
{{{
cd "/Library/Application Support/openlink/bin" ./oplmgr +stop ./oplmgr +start 
}}}
 
#If you get an error, execute these two commands (again, you can just copy-and-paste), and provide your Mac OS X user password when prompted -- 
{{{
sudo ./oplmgr +stop sudo ./oplmgr +start 
}}}
  
#Test your connection with the [[OpenLink|OpenLink]] ODBC Administrator.app or any other ODBC client application. 
#If license errors come up, reboot, and test again.  
#If errors persist, please [[http://support.openlinksw.com/support/online-support.vsp|log a Support Case]] .
