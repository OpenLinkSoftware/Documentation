#Navigate to the root directory of your OpenLink installation, where you find openlink.sh and openlink.csh.  
#Set the OpenLink environment by running the appropriate script for your shell. The following will work in most environments, but your required command may differ -- ****

  |  sh, bash, zsh and related |  . ./openlink.sh  |
 |  ksh and related |  source ./openlink.sh  |
 |  csh, tcsh and related |  source ./openlink.csh  |
   
#Execute this command -- 
{{{
cd bin 
}}}
 
#Retrieve your OpenLink license file from email or [[ODSBriefcaseLicenseStorage|ODS briefcase]] .  
#Transer the license to the current ($OPENLINK_INSTALL/bin/) directory on the Unix box, using binary-preserving methods (e.g., FTP in BIN mode, SCP, etc.)  
#Confirm that the OPL_LICENSE_DIR environment variable includes this directory. Exact commands may vary in your environment, but here is an example sequence based on the BASH shell -- 
{{{
echo $OPL_LICENSE_DIR /etc/oplmgr export OPL_LICENSE_DIR=/usr/openlink/bin:$OPL_LICENSE_DIR 
}}}
 
#Execute these commands -- 
{{{
./oplshut -fy ./oplrqb -dv 
}}}
 
#Launch a client application.  
#Test a connection to initialize the terms of the new license.  
#Once the license is confirmed, repeat the oplshut command, and restart the Broker using your normal command sequence.
