---++Creating user groups in ODS-Briefcase

ODS-Briefcase UI offers creating two kinds of user groups: regular groups and WebID groups.


Here is a sample scenario:

   1. Log in in http://cname:port/ods
   1. Go to Briefcase
   1. Go to Administration:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/b1.png" />%BR%%BR%  
      * To create <b>Regular</b> Group, follow [[ODSBriefcaseCreateGroupRegular][this]] scenario
      * To create <b>WebID</b> Group, follow [[ODSBriefcaseCreateGroupWebID][this]] scenario.
   1. Once created, the group can be used in the ODS-Briefcase sharing feature.
