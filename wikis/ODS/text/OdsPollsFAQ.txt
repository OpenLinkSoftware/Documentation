---++++ What is Polls?

ODS-Polls is an easy manager for creating, managing and voting on poll(s). 
By specifying visibility of the Polls instance to Public, you can set your 
polls to be visible for everyone.

---++++Why should I set up a poll?

Voting to poll is a cool way to collect statistical information about
interests, different topics you may want to find what other people's
opinion is.

---++++How is my poll organized?

Polls can be single- or multi-answered. Depending on this, after you have
entered the desired questions and answers, you may want to preview your
Poll.

When the Poll is created, in order people to be able to vote, it should be
activated. For security reasons you are not able to edit Poll when it is
activated.

----++++What is a tag?

A tag works like a keyword. You can tag a poll with several tags separated
by commas.

Example: tags for the poll you have created with name "Virtuoso" could be:
RDF, SPARQL, SQL.

Having many tags helps to have your polls be found more easily, but fewer
tags also help you with organizing your polls.

instance with visibility set to "Public".
