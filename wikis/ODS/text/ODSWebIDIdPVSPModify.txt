---+VSP pages modification notes

The VSP pages can be tested/used both in case they are located in OS file system / or DAV. 

By default the ODS Framework package installation creates 2 additional folders: 
   1. OS file system type folder: <code>vsp\vad\vsp\wa\webid</code>. 
   2. Virtual folder: <code>/ods/webid</code>, which is mapped to the <code>vsp\vad\vsp\wa\webid</code> folder from above.

---++Scenario 1
In case you want to add your own VSP page, you need to add it to the existing OS file system type folder <code>vsp\vad\vsp\wa\webid</code> / or to any DAV location. If you choose a DAV location, make sure you create a new virtual folder that is mapped to this DAV location. For ex.:

   1 Suppose your new VSP page is named mytest.vsp and you have placed it in DAV location <code>/DAV/home/demo</code>:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js11.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 To create a virtual folder for ex. with name <code>mytest</code>, go to Conductor -> Web Application Server -> Virtual Domains & Directories and expand the UI for your lets say Default Web Site:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js1.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "New Directory"
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js3.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Specify type: "WebDAV domain": 
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js4.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "Next"
   1 In the presented form specify:
      * Path: /mytest
      * Check-box "Physical path is a WebDAV repository" should be hatched.
      * Physical path: /DAV/home/demo/
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js5.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "Save Changes".
   1 Access your VSP page with the new created path: http://host:port/mytest/mytest.vsp
   1 After choosing a valid certificate, your modified VSP page should be presented:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js12.png" />%BR%%BR%

---++Scenario 2

In case you want to use another path for accessing your VSP page, different from the default virtual folder <code>/ods/webid</code>, you need to create a new virtual folder which is mapped to the OS file system type folder <code>vsp\vad\vsp\wa\webid</code>. 

   1 Suppose the VSP page webid_demo.vsp is located at your OS file system <code>vsp\vad\vsp\wa\webid</code> folder.
   1 To create a new virtual folder, for ex. <code>fstest</code> go to Conductor -> Web Application Server -> Virtual Domains & Directories and expand the UI for your lets say Default Web Site:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js1.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "New Directory"
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js3.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Specify type: "File system": 
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js7.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "Next"
   1 In the presented form specify:
      * Path: /fstest
      * Check-box "Physical path is a WebDAV repository" should be un-hatched.
      * Physical path: /vad/vsp/wa/webid
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js8.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "Save Changes".
   1 Access the VSP page with the new created path: http://host:port/fstest/webid_demo.vsp
   1 After choosing a valid certificate, the VSP page should be presented:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js13.png" />%BR%%BR%
