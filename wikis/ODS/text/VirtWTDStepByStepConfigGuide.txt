---++ Virtuoso <nop>WebID+TLS+Delegation Step by Step Configuration Guide

<nop>WebID+TLS+Delegation provides <nop>WebID authentication delegation whereby a user accessing a Virtuoso resource delegates identity authentication  to an actual software agent that interacts with the resource. In all cases the software agent is identified by a <nop>WebID. The semantics of this kind of delegated identity authentication is expressed through reciprocal relationship types <code>hasIdentityDelegate</code> and <code>onBehalfOf</code> represented by RDF statements stored in <nop>WebID profile documents of user(s) and software agents. 

---+++How it works

The process is as follows:
   1 Delegate's credentials (X.509 certificate and private key) are used to complete the basic TLS-handshake 
   1 Following successful TLS-handshake the reciprocal relationships in the users profile documents are verified by using them to locate the public key that was used successfully in the TLS-handshake 
   1 Resource access is granted following successful evaluation of Attribute-based based ACLs (ABAC) associated with the <nop>WebID of a given user (e.g. if connecting through isql, the user is identified by the <nop>WebID provided as the value of the -W option used with ISQL or /delegate connection attribute.


The primary benefit of <nop>WebID authentication delegation is that a single X.509 certificate can function as the identity card for a software agent used by many users, each of which is uniquely identified by their own <nop>WebIDs which are the targets of ABAC-based ACLs.
