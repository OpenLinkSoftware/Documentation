Very often ISP or mail server will install such a filtering program, which adds special headers to your email before it is retrieved by ODS-Mail. Currently supported are: SpamAssassin and SpamPal.
   * <b>Do not mark messages as junk mail if the sender is in my address book</b> prevents messages from being automatically marked as junk mail if the sender is listed in the user's AddressBook instances. The user can also set the scope of allowed mails to be the contacts of his contacts. This respectively goes with depth 1, 2, etc.
