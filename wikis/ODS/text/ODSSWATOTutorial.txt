---+ SWAT0 in terms of ODS functionality Tutorial

%TOC%

---++Actors
   1 Demo (a Person) owns a Personal Data Space that includes data spaces for structured Profile and Weblog oriented data.
   1 John (a Person) owns a Personal Data Space that primarily includes structured profile data.
   1 Mary (a Person) owns a Personal Data Space that primarily includes Feed subscriptions to Demo's Weblog.

This tutorial demonstrates the use of ODS functionality to deliver on the SWAT0 open social web usecase where the following activities occur:

   1 Demo creates a blog entry that mentions John.
   1 John receives notification about the blog entry.
   1 Mary receives notification via her subscription to Demo's weblog. 

---++ODS functionality in use

   * Content Creation (Blog Post).
   * Mobile Blogging (use of Email messaging to create content e.g. Photos captured on a mobile phone which are emailed to Weblog data space).
   * Notifications (via Semantic Pingback mechanism).
