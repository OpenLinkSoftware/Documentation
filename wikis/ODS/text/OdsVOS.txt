ODS has been development to provide and a coherent nexus for Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web (also known as Data Web).  All ODS application Data Spaces can be queried via [[OdsGData][Google's GData protocol]].  All Data Space front-end pages offer RSS 2.0, ATOM 1.0, and RSS 1.1 (RSS-RDF) content syndication feeds, FOAF (for individual Data Space insights covering data and social networks), VCard , XBEL and other standard  data interchange formats where applicable.
