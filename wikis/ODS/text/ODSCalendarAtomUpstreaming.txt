---++ODS Calendar Atom based upstream support

ODSCalendar now supports Atom based upstreaming. Any Calendar instance can be configured to escalate any changes to one or several remoted ODS Calendar instances.

---+++ Configuration

Upstreaming can be configured from <b>Preferences</b>-><b>Upstreams</b>

The form for adding or changing existing upstream contains following fields:

| * Field * | * Value *|
| Name | name of the upstream - list of upstreams actually a list of such names |
| URI | URI of remote ODSCalendar Atom endpoint. Usually it is something like http://host:port/dataspace/{ods-user}/calendar/{calendar-instance}/atom-pub |
| User| name of user who has write permissions on the remote ODSCalendar instance |
| Password | password of *user* |    
| Include with tags | Calendar object with this tags will be upstreamed. |    
| Exclude with tags| Calendar object with this tags will not be upstreamed. |    

The upstreaming is performed on the interval set in the Virtuoso database ini file for paramater <b><nowiki>SchedulerInterval</nowiki></b> in the <b>[Parameters]</b> section.

---+++Simple example:

We will use the following data from http://myopenlink.net:8890/ods:

   1. User test1 is an owner of a  test1Calendar Calendar instance.
