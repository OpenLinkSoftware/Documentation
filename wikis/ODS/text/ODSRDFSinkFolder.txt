---++ODS RDF Sink Folder

%TOC%

Virtuoso's [[http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/dataspace/dav/wiki/Main/WebDAV][WebDAV]] supports a special folder for RDF uploads, named <b><code>rdf_sink</code></b>.

   * When a new user is created, a new <nowiki>WebDAV</nowiki> folder with name <b><code>rdf_sink</code></b> is created in the user's home directory; 
   * The folder has two properties - <b><code>virt:rdf_graph</code></b> and <b><code>virt:rdf_sponger</code></b>. The names of the <nowiki>WebDAV</nowiki> properties are prefixed with <b><code>virt:</code></b>. The properties of the other DET folders are also prefixed in the same way. Properties prefixed with <b><code>virt:</code></b> are not shown as resource/collection properties in the ODS Briefcase - they can be seen only in the Conductor. Uploaded resources in the <b><code>rdf_sink</code></b> folder don't have any special properties.
      1 The property <b><code>virt:rdf_graph</code></b> contains the name of the graph for uploads. 
      1 The property <b><code>virt:rdf_sponger</code></b> points to the upload method. If it is <b>on</b>, then the content of every file uploaded to that folder is added to the RDF store using the Sponger method. If this value is <b>off</b>, then only files with special mime types are added to the RDF store. After the first upload into the folder a new file is created too and it has name based on the RDF Graph Name. This file is dynamic and contains all uploaded triplets; 
   * There is a procedure for automatic creation of an <b><code>rdf_sink</code></b> folder in each ODS users home directory. The ODS Register User page can also be updated so that an <b><code>rdf_sink</code></b> folder will be created for every ODS user.
   * ODS Briefcase UI supports <b><code>rdf_sink</code></b>-like folders (create and update);

From the ODS Briefcase UI, a user may see properties for this folder using the "Properties" button at the right of the folder name. The opened page shows tab with name "RDF Upload" and 2 fields:
   * *Graph name*, e.g., <code><nowiki>http://demo.openlinksw.com/DAV/home/demo/rdf_sink</nowiki></code>
   * *Sponger* (on/off), defaults to <code><nowiki>on</nowiki></code>.

The UI is the same as for other DET folders. On the "Main" tab > field "Folder Type" contains "RDF Upload Folder". You may set this type for other <nowiki>WebDAV</nowiki> folders and set field values in the "RDF Upload" tab.


<b>Note:</b> In order the rdf_sink folder to work correctly, you need to make sure the [[http://download.openlinksw.com/packages/5.0/virtuoso/rdf_mappers_dav.vad][rdf mappers package]] is installed.

---+++Example
User demo uploads an rdf file to his <b><code>rdf_sink</code></b> folder at <code><nowiki>http://demo.openlinksw.com/ods</nowiki></code> :
   1 Go to demo user Briefcase UI home page
   1 Upload the RDF file ('<code>TimBLcard.rdf</code>') to the "rdf_sink" folder. 
   1 After upload a file with name "<code><nowiki>http___demo.openlinksw.com_DAV_home_demo_rdf_sink_.RDF</nowiki></code>" is created. When its name link is clicked in the ODS Briefcase UI, the triples are downloaded.
