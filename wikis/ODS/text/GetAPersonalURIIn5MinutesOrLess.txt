---+ Get a Personal URI (a/k/a WebID) in 5 minutes or less!

By the end of this Quick Tutorial you will have:

   * Your own Personal URI, or WebID, which will be valid for linking to/from any Linked Data service.
   * Your own Data Space with Profiling, Social Networking, Blog, and Wiki capabilities, which is fully compliant with Semantic Web and <nowiki>DataPortability</nowiki> standards.

---++ Step 1

Go to an <b>[[Ods][OpenLink Data Spaces]] (ODS) instance</b>, such as the <b>MyOpenLink WebID server</b>, [[http://id.myopenlink.net/ods/][http://id.myopenlink.net/ods/]].

---++ Step 2

Click the <b>Sign Up</b> link, found in the top right hand corner --

---++ Step 3


   1 Create a new account on this service, by one of these methods
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ODS_User_Reg.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
      * Click to the <b>WebID</b> tab, to use an existing WebID from another site, whether ODS or otherwise;
      * Click to the <b>OpenID</b> tab, to use an existing OpenID from another provider (such as LiveJournal or MyOpenID); 
      * Click to the <b>Facebook</b>, <b>Twitter</b>, or <b>LinkedIn</b> tab, to use existing credentials from these sites;
      * Or stay on the <b>Digest</b> tab, specify a new login name, provide a valid email address, and set a password.
   1 Review the <b>Terms of Service</b>, and tick the checkbox. 
   1 Click the <b>Sign Up</b> button.

---++ Step 4

   1 After you've logged in, there will now be an <b>Edit Profile</b> link on the ODS toolbar. Click it to edit your profile.
      * Add personal information such as your name, gender, birthday, and personal webpage. 
      * An important field on this form is the <b>Other Identity URIs (synonyms)</b>, which links your ODS URI with other identities on the web.
      * More tabs allow you to enter details about your Contact information, your Home location, and your Business/Work details. You can even hook it into various systems such as Amazon, Ebay, Facebook, Flickr, and Google.
      * There is a <b>Made</b> tab, which will link your ODS identity with various other resources that you have made on the Web; for example, <nowiki>YouTube</nowiki> videos, Wiki pages, or Blog articles.
      * The <b>Related</b> tab is used for creating custom Semantic triples, and could be used for linking to another page/resource about yourself.
   1 Make sure that you click the <b>Save</b> button after making all your changes.

---++ Step 5

Now that you have finished editing your profile, you have a fully de-referenceable WebID, or Personal URI. 

If you click on your username on the top right hand corner, it will take you to your profile page and the address in the browser will be your Personal URI.  If you are using [[http://id.myopenlink.net/ods/][the MyOpenLink WebID server]], it will be of the form:
<verbatim>
http://id.myopenlink.net/dataspace/person/<Your-Username>#this
</verbatim>
For example, my personal URI is:
<verbatim>
http://id.myopenlink.net/dataspace/person/kidehen#this
</verbatim>

---++ All done!

You can now explore [[Ods][OpenLink Data Spaces]] (ODS) a bit more.  There are some applications you can instantiate such as blogs, wikis, and feed readers. You can also use this system as an OpenID server when signing up for services on other third-party websites.
