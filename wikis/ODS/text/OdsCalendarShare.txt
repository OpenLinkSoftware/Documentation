---+ Sharing in ODS-Calendar 

ODS-Calendar allows users to share their calendars with other users in the relevant ODS data space. Here is a sample scenario:

   1. Log in as the <b>demo</b> user, and go to the Calendar.

   1. Go to <b>Preferences.</b>
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c2.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Click <b>Share my Calendar.</b>
   1. The <b>Sharing to user(s)</b> form will open. 
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c3.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Click the <b>Select</b> button to choose ODS user(s), or enter them directly in the "User(s)" field. 
   1. If you click the <b>Select</b> button, a new window will open with a list of all registered users in this ODS instance. You can select users directly, or make a filter. In our example, we will select the <b>test1</b> user.

   1. You can enable or disable sharing for a selected user by ticking (or un-ticking) the <b>Enable</b> check-box, and set the Share mode to <b>Read Only</b> or <b>Read/Write</b>.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c4.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Click the <b>Share</b> button to save your settings.
   1. Now you'll see a list of all users to whom your calendar has been shared, including the new user(s). In our case, this is just user <b>test1</b>.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c5.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Now let's see what user <b>test1</b> has in their Calendar. Log out as user <b>demo</b>, and log in as user <b>test1</b>.  Then, go to Calendar.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c6.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Go to <b>Preferences</b> -> <b>Accepted Calendars</b> to see all calendars to which you've already subscribed (i.e., accepted).
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c7.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Click the <b>Accept</b> button to review those for which sharing has been offered, but which you have not yet accepted (i.e., subscribed to).
   1. For "Calendar type", choose <b>Shared to me</b> to select from calendars shared specifically with you, or <b>Public</b> to select from Public Calendars (i.e., calendars shared with all ODS users); then click the "Select Shared" button.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c8.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. In the pop-up window, select the <b>demo</b> user's calendar, "<b>mycalendar</b>".
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c9.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. The "My Accepted Calendars/Create" form will now have "mycalendar" in the <b>Calendar name</b> field. Tasks and other items from this calendar will be shown in the "<b>Color</b>" you set here.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c10.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Click the <b>Accept</b> button, and the <b>Accepted Calendars</b> list will be updated to reflect your changes.
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c11.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
   1. Now user <b>test1</b>'s calendar also shows the shared tasks and events from user <b>demo</b>'s calendar.  Because <b>demo</b> shared their calendar as <b>Read Only</b>, items from that calendar will not be editable; i.e.,
      * the <b>Events</b> tab will show the shared events with a gray rectangle, rather than a selection check-box, in the first column of the list:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c12.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
      * the <b>Tasks</b> tab will show the shared tasks with a gray rectangle, rather than a selection check-box,  in the first column of the list:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/c13.png" style="wikiautogen"/>%BR%%BR%
