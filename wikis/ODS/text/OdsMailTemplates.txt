The implemented actions are:

   * Create*
The templates can be created as regular mail messages but must contain placeholders. When the template is ready a 'Save' action is used for save.

   * Edit - Similar as 'Create' action.
   * Mail Merge - use this action to merge selected template with data source. See [[OdsMailMerge][ODS Mail Merge]].
   * Delete - check first the unneeded templates and then a 'Delete' action is used.
