---++ ODS Feed Manager Corporate Use Case:  Documentation

Internal corporate documentation -- training manuals, employee handbooks, product collateral including datasheets and  sales tool kits -- gets updated on a fairly regular basis.  Changes to these documents need to be gotten into the hands of staff in a timely fashion so they are aware of new procedures, updates to exiting policies, modified product features, and pricing changes.    

Corporations posting changes to the documents can provide feeds for content found in internal web sites, blogs, or wikis.
