---+ ODS Facebook Integration Guide

An ODS Instance Administrator may register that Instance as a Facebook Client Application.  

Users of the ODS Instance can then link their ODS account with their Facebook account, allowing them to log in to ODS using their Facebook credentials, and/or integrate ODS content and services with Facebook content and services. 

   * Active Facebook user cookies and/or session data in the web browser which is accessing the ODS-Facebook page are used to --
      * display data about that Facebook user on the ODS-Facebook page
      * display a list of that Facebook user's friends on the ODS-Facebook page

   * The ODS user can link a new or existing <nowiki>ODS-AddressBook</nowiki> instance to their Facebook account, and 
      * populate it with contact info for his/her Facebook friends.
      * update contact info based on what is retrieved from Facebook.

   * All data for the Facebook friends of the logged-in user is automatically imported to ODS (Virtuoso) as RDF.
      * The data is updated each time the user visits this page.
      * After successful RDF data import, "rdf" icons - <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/rdf.png" style="wikiautogen"/> - alongside each Facebook friend's name become dereferenceable links to the RDF data.

Below, we discuss how to enable and use these features.
