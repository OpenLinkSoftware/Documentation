---+Javascript pages modification notes

The Javascript pages can be tested/used both in case they are located in OS file system / or DAV. 

By default with the ODS Framework package installation is created virtual folder <code>/ods/webid</code> which is mapped to the created created by default OS file system type folder <code>vsp\vad\vsp\wa\webid</code>. 

---++Scenario 1
In case you want to add your own Javascript page, you need to add it to the existing OS file system type folder <code>vsp\vad\vsp\wa\webid</code> / or to any DAV location. If you choose a DAV location, make sure you create a new virtual folder that is mapped to this DAV location. For ex.:

   1 Suppose your new Javascript page is named mytest.html and you have placed it in DAV location <code>/DAV/home/demo</code>:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js2.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 To create a virtual folder for ex. <code>mytest</code>, go to Conductor -> Web Application Server -> Virtual Domains & Directories and expand the UI for your lets say Default Web Site:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js1.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "New Directory"
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js3.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Specify type: "WebDAV domain": 
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js4.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "Next"
   1 In the presented form specify:
      * Path: /mytest
      * Check-box "Physical path is a WebDAV repository" should be hatched.
      * Physical path: /DAV/home/demo/
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js5.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "Save Changes".
   1 Access your Javascript page with the new created path: http://host:port/mytest/mytest.html
   1 After choosing a valid certificate, your modified Javascript page should be presented:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js6.png" />%BR%%BR%

---++Scenario 2

In case you want to use another path for accessing your Javascript page, different from the default virtual folder <code>/ods/webid</code>, you need to create a new virtual folder which is mapped to the OS file system type folder <code>vsp\vad\vsp\wa\webid</code>. 

   1 Suppose the Javascript page webid_demo.html is located at your OS file system <code>/vsp/vad/vsp/wa</code> folder.
   1 To create a new virtual folder, for ex. <code>fstest</code> go to Conductor -> Web Application Server -> Virtual Domains & Directories and expand the UI for your lets say Default Web Site:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js1.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "New Directory"
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js3.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Specify type: "File system": 
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js7.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "Next"
   1 In the presented form specify:
      * Path: /fstest
      * Check-box "Physical path is a WebDAV repository" should be un-hatched.
      * Physical path: /vad/vsp/wa/webid
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js8.png" />%BR%%BR%
   1 Click "Save Changes".
   1 Access the Javascript page with the new created path: http://host:port/fstest/webid_demo.html
   1 After choosing a valid certificate, the Javascript page should be presented:
%BR%%BR%<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/js9.png" />%BR%%BR%
