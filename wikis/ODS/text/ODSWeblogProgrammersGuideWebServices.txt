---+++Upstreams

---++++What is upstreaming?

Upstreaming keeps your blogs synchronized amongst your various blog sites, should you have more than one. This allows you to maintain all of your blogging centrally, and then upstream portions to appropriate servers based on whether they are private, public or for your organization or of various topics.

Upstreaming is how you enable OpenLink Virtuoso to automatically route blog posts to other blogs that you may own, the only requirement is that these blog systems support any one of the following blog post APIs: Atom, Blogger, Meta-Weblog, or Moveable Type. This also implies that you can use a single Blog Post Client (w.Bloggar, Newzcrawler, Zempt, and others) to post to several blogs.

---++++Configuration

Upstreaming can be configured in Settings -> Upstreams.

The form for adding or changing existing upstream contains following fields:

|*Name*|*Description*|*Default Values*|
|Endpoint |Is the XML-RPC/SOAP endpoint that support SOAP based blogger API for your blog site. For OpenLink Virtuoso servers the endpoint typically ends with /RPC2, but this is configurable.||
|User/Password |The credentials required for accessing your blog site.||
|API Type |The Blog API system type. One of: Atom, Blogger, MetaWebLog or Moveable Type||
|BlogID|The system ID for your blog account on the server. This is rarely known so the Fetch button can be used to obtain it once the above information has been provided.||
|Exclude |Is an exception list to remove categories from this upstream entry.||

---++++Upstreaming Log
