<para>Counting is inherently slow.
 Even more so when you need to read the stuff you count from disk.
 If you need faster disk access I recommend using more disks and spread them on different SATA buses (if you&#39;ve SATA disk) and tell Virtuoso to use stripes.
 This way you&#39;ll have more Disk I/O bandwidth and parallelization.
