<para>The Virtuoso Server writes a number of different logs, at a number of different levels, <ulink url="http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/dbadm.html">depending on various INI settings</ulink>.</para><para>The &quot;<computeroutput>Transaction aborted because its log after image size went above the limit</computeroutput>&quot; error generally indicates that the roll-forward log entry of a transaction has exceeded the size set by <ulink url="http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/dbadm.html#ini_Parameters">TransactionAfterImageLimit</ulink>, which defaults to 50Mb.</para><para>To resolve this problem, you can try increasing this setting -- but note that transaction roll-back data takes about twice as much space as roll-forward data.
 Hence, when a transaction&#39;s roll-forward data is 50Mb, the total transient consumption is closer to 150 Mb.</para><para>If you&#39;ve encountered this error while loading RDF data, consider using the <ulink url="http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/dataspace/doc/dav/wiki/Main/VirtBulkRDFLoader">Bulk Loading scripts</ulink> which were built to prevent such issues.</para><para> </para></section></docbook>
