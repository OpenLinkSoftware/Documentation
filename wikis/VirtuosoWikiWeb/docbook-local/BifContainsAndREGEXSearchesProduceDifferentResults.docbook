    <bridgehead class="h3"><ulink url=""/>bif:contains and REGEX Searches
    Produce Different Results</bridgehead>bif:contains looks for phrases
    or independent words, and it may normalize words that use
    non-canonical Unicode chars. It can also search in XML/HTML
    documents. In addition, even if one and the same query string
    is valid for both REGEX and bif:contains, then the meaning
    may differ. For REGEX, pattern "Paris Hilton" is precisely two
    words delimited by single whitespace byte. For bif:contains, "Paris Hilton"
    means that the document should contain word "Paris" and word
    "Hilton",
    in any places and in any order. See <ulink url="http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/queryingftcols.html">http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/queryingftcols.html</ulink>
    for details of bif:contains query string
    syntax.
