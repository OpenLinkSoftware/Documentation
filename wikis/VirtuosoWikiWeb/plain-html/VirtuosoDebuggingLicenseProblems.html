<p>License problems occur when users attempt to apply them to products or when they hit a ceiling associated with concurrent usage.
 Most license errors are explicit and include text that states that a license is invalid, expired, or exceeded.
 Problems associated with performance or stability problems that do not produce license related errors are not likely to be caused by licenses.
 There is no scenario in which use of an evaluation key would contribute to limited functionality.
 <nop></nop>OpenLink&#39;s products are fully functional regardless of the license key applied.
 The license key simply dictates the length of time for which a product may be used.</p><h3><a name="Source of License Problems"></a>Source of License Problems</h3>
