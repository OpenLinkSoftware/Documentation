<p>Use the following instructions to troubleshoot performance issues associated with DBpedia loads --</p><p>1.
 Ensure that you have set <nop></nop>NumberOfBuffers and <nop></nop>MaxDirtyBuffers in the ini file as described here<a href="http://wikis.openlinksw.com:80/dataspace/owiki/wiki/VirtuosoWikiWeb/Here&parent=DBpediaPerformanceIssue" class="wikiword">?</a>.</p><p>2.
 Ensure that you have set the default transaction isolation mode in [Parameters]  - &quot;<nop></nop>DefaultIsolation </p><p> 2&quot; (Read Committed)</p><p>3.
 If you have the hardware set up so that you have more physical disk devices on separate buses, you may benefit from additional I/O parallelization by setting Virtuoso to use striped DB - i.e.
 store the DB in slices on different physical devices.</p><p>4 Pay close attention to various system load indicators to see if the process is I/O or CPU bound in order to see if excessive I/O, due to swapping or the process running out of memory is causing this - when the process has enough RAM and the system&#39;s I/O devices and read buffering are healthy, the virtuoso-t process should hit and sustain <br>close to 100% usage on both cores during most of the load.
 Use &#39;top&#39; to see the CPU usage stats while loading.
