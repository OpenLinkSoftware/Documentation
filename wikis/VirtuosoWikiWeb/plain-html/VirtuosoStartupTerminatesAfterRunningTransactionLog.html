</pre><p> <br>If this is the case, you may have a corrupt database.
 Contact <nop></nop>OpenLink Product Support and provide the following information:</p><p>1.
 How big is the database associated with the server starting up?</p><p>2.
 Is this VOS? f so, what C compiler flags were used to compile Virtuoso? Was -O used?  Was Virtuoso compiled with debug symbols? If so, start it under GDB and provide the call stack for the GPF&#39;ing thread.</p><p>3.
 Are you using the same Virtuoso executable that you used during the last successful startup?</p><p>4.
 How big is your transaction log file (virtuoso.trx).</p><p>5.
 What happens if you backup virtuoso.trx to a new location and start Virtuoso without it?</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a crash dump - rebuild procedure for corrupt databases.
 See <a href="http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/backup_recovery/" class="absuri">http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/backup_recovery/</a> and  look for the &quot;Database Recovery&quot; section.</p></div></body></html>
