<p>The following steps will detail what is required to manually create <strong>Associations</strong> in your Entity Data Model.</p><p>You will need to determine where these associations exist and their multiplicity (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.) before commencing with the following steps.
 <i><b>NOTE:</b> These steps will need to be repeated for each association.</i></p><p>1.
 The first Association I will deal with is the relationship between <b><code>Customer</code></b> and <b><code>Invoice</code></b>, identified by the presence of the scalar property <b><code>Cust_Num</code></b> in both entities.
 This is a one-to-many relationship, as a Customer may have any number of Invoices.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs01.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>2.
 To add the Association, right click on the <b><code>Customer</code></b> entity, then <strong>Add</strong> -&gt; <strong>Association</strong>.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs02.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>3.
 You will now see the <strong>Add Association</strong> dialog.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs03.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>4.
 For this association, the only thing that needs changing is the default name assigned to the <strong>Navigation Property</strong>.
 Change the default from <b><code>Invoice</code></b> to <b><code>invoices</code></b> on the <b><code>Customer</code></b> end of the association.<br><br>This better reflects the multiplicity of the association such that a Customer is associated with zero or many Invoices (plural).
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs04.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br>Typically, here is where you will -<br><br></p><ul><li> Select the entity at each end of the association <br></li>
<li> Select the multiplicity of each end of the association, and <br></li>
<li> Provide suitable names for the association and its navigation properties<br><br></li>
</ul><p>5.
 Hit <strong>OK</strong>.
 The diagram will be refreshed to include the newly created association.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs05.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>6.
 You now need to edit the mappings associated with the newly created association, so right-click the association on the diagram.
 Then, select <strong>Table Mapping</strong> to display the <strong>Mapping Details</strong> pane.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs06.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>7.
 Click the line which reads <b>&lt;Add a Table or View&gt;</b> to reveal a drop down list of all entities.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs07.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>8.
 Here you need to select the entity on the right/far side of the association (the entity where the foreign key exists).<br><br>In this example, it is the <b><code>Invoice</code></b> entity.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs08.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>9.
 The <strong>Mapping Details</strong> pane now refreshes to display both ends of the association.
 Now, you must provide relevant target store data types in the <strong>Column</strong> column for the key fields, as depicted here.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs09.png" style="wikiautogen"> <br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs10.png" style="wikiautogen"> <br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs11.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>10.
 Once the mapping is complete, you can build the project using <strong>Build</strong> -&gt; <strong>Build Solution</strong>.
 <i><b>NOTE:</b> It is worthwhile building as each association is made, since the error messages can be a little confusing.</i> <br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs12.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>11.
 This should result in the following error, which is included here since I (the author) found it misleading.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs13.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br> <br>This error indicates that there are two source columns — in this case, the Invoice entity&#39;s Scalar Property <b><code>Cust_Num</code></b> and Navigation Property <b><code>Customer</code></b> — which are both mapped to the same target column — the Progress column <b><code>Invoice.Cust_Num</code></b> — and this is not supported.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs14.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>12.
 The solution is simple! Simply delete the mapping of the Scalar Property <b><code>Invoice.Cust_Num</code></b>.
 Its only purpose is to hold data representing a relationship/association (it is a Foreign Key), which has already been represented by the newly created association and resulting Navigation Property <b><code>Customer</code></b>.<br><br> <br>Right click on <b><code>Invoice.Cust_Num</code></b> then <strong>Delete</strong>.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs15.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>13.
 The model diagram will refresh to reflect this change.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs16.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>14.
 Build the project, again, using <strong>Build</strong> -&gt; <strong>Build Solution</strong>.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs12.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>15.
 The project should now build fine.
<br><br><br><img src="VirtProgressAssociations/ProgressEDMFKs17.png" style="wikiautogen"><br><br></p><p>You will need to repeat these steps for each association, until you have a completed Entity Data Model.
