=== {{{bif:contains }}}and REGEX Searches Produce Different Results 
 {{{bif:contains }}}looks for phrases or independent words, and it may normalize words that use non-canonical Unicode chars. It can also search in XML/HTML documents. In addition, even if one and the same query string is valid for both REGEX and {{{bif:contains }}}, then the meaning may differ. For REGEX, pattern "Paris Hilton" is precisely two words delimited by single whitespace byte. For {{{bif:contains }}}, "Paris Hilton" means that the document should contain word "Paris" and word "Hilton", in any places and in any order. See [[http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/queryingftcols.html|http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/queryingftcols.html]] for details of {{{bif:contains }}}query string syntax.
