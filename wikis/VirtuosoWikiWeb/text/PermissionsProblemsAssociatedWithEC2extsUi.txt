===Permissions problems associated with EC2exts Ui===

While the new AWS Management Console ([[https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home]]) now allows for logins using the email address and password associated with your AWS account, but the EC2exts Ui does not and still requires the access key credentials as do the FF plugins.  You can obtain this information from the AWS Management  
console by, clicking on the "My Account" bread crumb link in the top  right and clicking on the "Access Identifiers" link presented.

Note: We are working to determine whether the EC2exts UI can be enhanced to take the AWS login credentials as the AWS Management Console does.
