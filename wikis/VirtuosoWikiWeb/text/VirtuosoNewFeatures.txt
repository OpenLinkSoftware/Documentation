== Enhancements to v5.0.8 ==

* SQL compiler is now re-entrant
* Self-Join optimizations exposed at JDBC Driver level (as was already the case with ODBC)
* SPARQL engine and SPARQL-BI extension optimizations have been merged
* <nop>TriG serialization format for RDF is now supported alongside RDFa, N3, Turtle, and RDF/XML
* Additional Sponger Cartridges for Digg, <nop>FriendFeed, and <nop>CrunchBase
* Improved graph quality and fidelity from existing Cartridges (especially Freebase, eBay, Amazon, Google, Yahoo, and many others)
* Improved handling of and bug fixes relating to the `OPTIONAL' SPARQL keyword
* Self-Dereferencing fixes (e.g., Sponger was not properly de-referencing its own Proxy URIs)

On the ODS front, the following have been addressed:

* More flexible Mapping service model based on new OAT-based Mapping Control (which also includes a "province" locator)
* Improved <nop>SyncML integration with Briefcase folders
* Gem URL fixes for Atom, RSS, and RDF feeds


== Enhancements to v5.0.7 ==


New: fully operational Native Graph Model Storage Providers for the Jena & Sesame Frameworks. Licensing change: the Jena and Sesame providers have been added to the "Client Protocol Driver exemptions" paragraph in the VOS License: http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/dataspace/dav/wiki/Main/VOSLicense

Improvements:
* Better support for alternate RDF indexing schemes
* Parallelization of RDF sponger operations across multiple RDF data-sources concurrently
* New Sponger Cartridges and enhancements to the existing Cartridge collection
* Inference engine optimizations for subclass and subproperty that efficiently handle taxonomies numbering tens of thousands of classes.
* OWL equivalentClass and equivalentProperty inference support.

* ODS applications now support <nop>SyncML

Documentation Additions:

* How to debug RDF views
* Better Documentation on SPARQL extensions and options
* An updated RDF View example based on the Northwind demonstration database that reflects underlying enhancements

Bug Fixes:
* Generally improved safety of built-in functions, better argument checking.
* Verified UTF8 internationl character support in all RDF use cases, SQL client/SPARQL protocol/all data formats.
* Generally improved safety of built-in functions, better argument checking.
