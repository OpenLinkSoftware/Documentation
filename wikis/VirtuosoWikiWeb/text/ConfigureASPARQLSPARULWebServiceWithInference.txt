You can place any 'define param value' configuration options in SH_DEFINES field of appropriate row of DB.DBA.SYS_SPARQL_HOST . In that
table, SH_HOST is a mask for hostname so the row will be used for any HTTP request such that some name from 'Host:' HTTP header line is LIKE SH_HOST, SH_GRAPH_URI is "default default graph" that is used if the request does not specify default graph, SH_DEFINES is a string of options that are inserted at the very beginning of any query before execution.
