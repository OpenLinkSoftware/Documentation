**Mashup** : Mashups are web-based applications that combine data from two or more, external and unrelated data sources. Mashups merge the disparate data for the purpose of creating a new service. Mashups employ brute force data joins and do not adhere to the data models underlying the original data. They typically involve use of RSS which is itself characterized as tree structured data with untyped links that are devoid of any type of semantic meaning. Compare with meshup.
