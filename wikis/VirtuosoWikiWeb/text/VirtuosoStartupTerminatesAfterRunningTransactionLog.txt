===Virtuoso Startup Terminates After Running Transaction Log===

Does your Virtuoso server process startup and then abort after running the transaction log. Do you see entries like the following in your virtuoso.log file? 

{{{
08:52:24 OpenLink Virtuoso Universal Server
08:52:24 Version 05.08.3034-pthreads for Linux as of Oct  2 2008
08:52:24 uses parts of OpenSSL, PCRE, Html Tidy
08:52:24 Database version 3016

}}}

If this is the case, you may have a corrupt database. Contact <nop>OpenLink Product Support and provide the following information:

1. How big is the database associated with the server starting up?

2. Is this VOS? f so, what C compiler flags were used to compile Virtuoso? Was -O used?  Was Virtuoso compiled with debug symbols? If so, start it under GDB and provide the call stack for the GPF'ing thread.

3. Are you using the same Virtuoso executable that you used during the last successful startup?

4. How big is your transaction log file (virtuoso.trx).

5. What happens if you backup virtuoso.trx to a new location and start Virtuoso without it?

**Note:** There is a crash dump - rebuild procedure for corrupt databases. See [[http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/backup_recovery/]] and  look for the "Database Recovery" section.
