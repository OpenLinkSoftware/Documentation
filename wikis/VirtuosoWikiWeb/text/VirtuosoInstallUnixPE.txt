== Installation ==

Once the required tar file has been downloaded from the web or ftp site and placed in a designated installation directory the installation process is ready to commence. 

# Choose or create a suitable user account to own your Virtuoso installation.
# Un-tar the file to obtain the install script and archive file using a command like this, where XX specifies the OS identifier (e.g., {{{l3 =}}} Linux glibc23 x86, {{{l9 =}}} Linux glibc25 x86_64, {{{sv =}}} Solaris 2.10 x86_64, etc.):
{{{
tar -xvf XXvpz2zz.tar
}}}
# If a license file exists, place this in the same directory as the installation files, and it will automatically be applied during installation. If upgrading an existing Virtuoso instance, be sure to take a backup of your database file and shut down the existing instance before proceeding.
# Run the install script using the following command:
{{{
$ sh ./install.sh
