==Unicode & Charset Issues==

===Encoding Issues Associated with <nop>DBpedia Queries===

The official dbpedia endpoint has the following setting in the "[HTTP  Server]" section of the virtuoso.ini configuration file:

{{{
Charset                     = utf-8
}}}

Which is not set in the default configuration files, thus if you have not set this yourself, please check, set it accordingly, restart your Virtuoso instance and try your query again.
