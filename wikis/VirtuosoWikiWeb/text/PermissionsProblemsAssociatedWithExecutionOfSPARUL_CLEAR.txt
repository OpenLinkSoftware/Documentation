===Permissions problems associated with execution of SPARUL_CLEAR===

Q: What do I need to grant an account to enable it to clear graphs with a SPARUL query?

A: Grant {{{SPARQL_UPDATE}}} privilege to user 'SPARQL' .  We don't grant this by default for security reasons.

If the problem persists, manually add these grants:

{{{
grant execute on SPARUL_CLEAR to "SPARQL"
grant execute on SPARUL_CLEAR to SPARQL_UPDATE
}}}
