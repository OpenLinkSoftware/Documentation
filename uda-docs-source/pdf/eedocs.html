      OpenLink Express Edition drivers enhance the common perception of an
      ODBC driver - a single component installed on the desktop or
      workstation machine only - by not requiring any further installation
      of database-specific networking on the client, or components on the
      database-server. Once installed, it provides seamless connectivity to
      the databases. The Express Edition drivers have been designed in
      harmony with Apple&#39;s Mac Universal Platform. Maximum capability,
      minimum effort.

    <P>
      The OpenLink Express Edition driver is a client-only installation and
      goes some way to ensure the job for developers, administrators and
      end-users is simplified. Part of this process means installing the
      software in one location as opposed to numerous locations. By
      discarding the server-side setup, there is no server-side
      administration so the user has only a single entry-point for
      installation and administration. In the majority of cases, knowing
      the database by name is all that is required.
    </P>
    <P>
      To the developer writing an application, there is no requirement to
      know on which server it resides: you can write your application for
      any environment, regardless of where it will end. There are also
      performance benefits gained by employing this single solution, which
      in some cases exceeds that provided by the database vendor&#39;s drivers.
      Being able to integrate your solution simply into your organization
      with its plethora of internal and disparate systems means your RoI
      increases significantly.
    </P>
    <!-- NEED 15 --><H3 CLASS="sect2head"><A NAME="eearch">Driver Architecture</A></H3>
      <P>
        These drivers are built by implementing the ODBC data-access
        interface specifications directly connecting to the database. There
        are no limiting factors as with traditional Single-Tier solutions.
      </P>
      <P>
        The Express Edition drivers are Type-B- or -C-based remote
        procedure calls (RPC) interface to the wire-protocol of the
        underlying database. This is a client-only interface that
        communicates directly with the remote database server. These
        interfaces typically are unavailable to third-party developers. To
        date the Open Source projects such as FreeTDS, MySQL, PostgreSQL
        and Interbase are the only publicly accessible and freely available
        versions of such interfaces.
      </P>
      <P>
        The ODBC Express Edition drivers offer developers an opportunity to
        develop generic solutions across platforms without prior knowledge
        of the operating system hosting the Database server.

    </A></H3>
    <P>
      As of UDA release 6.0 and above, OpenLink have moved the handling of
      licenses from individual products into a specific License Manager
process.
      This takes the form of an executable, (`oplmgr&#39;), from which all
      OpenLink commercial products request licenses via network
      connections.
    </P>
  <!-- NEED 15 -->
    <H3 CLASS="sect2head"><A NAME="oplmgrst">Single-Tier
    </A></H3>
    <P>
      OpenLink UDA Single-Tier is a single driver installed on the
      client only. 
    </P>
    <P>
      For releases 6.0, the oplmgr process was
      started automatically by the driver on first connection. As of
      release 6.1, this behaviour has changed; in order to facilitate use
      of License Manager process for administering licenses of all OpenLink
products simultaneously on the same machine, the license-manager
      must be started explicitly started in advance of services that will
use it. The release 6.1 installers now check if a License Manager (oplmgr)
process is already running and if not start their own local instance.

    <H3 CLASS="sect2head"><A NAME="oplmgrmt">Multi-Tier
    </A></H3>
    <P>
      OpenLink UDA Multi-Tier drivers comprise at least 3 components: a
      generic client installed on client machines, all of which contact a
      central request broker which spawns an RDBMS-specific database agent
      to connect to the specific database requested. The request-broker
      asks the license-manager for licenses for every connection requested.
    </P>
    <P>
      For UDA release 6.0, the oplmgr process was
      started automatically by the request-broker (oplrqb). As of release
      6.1, this behaviour has changed. In order that you should only need
      one license-manager per server, handling licenses for a variety of
      products (particularly combinations of Multi-Tier and OpenLink
      Virtuoso Universal Server), the license-manager must now be explicitly
started
       before other services requiring it. The release 6.1 installers now
check if a License Manager (oplmgr) process is already running and if not
start their own local instance.

      The OpenLink License Manager will search through directories in the

      variable, for files matching *.lic.
    </P>
    <P>
      OpenLink recommends you use /etc/oplmgr/ to store your licenses; each
      product installation will include a copy of the oplmgr executable in
      its respective &#39;bin&#39; directory, such that if this is the only
      OpenLink product on the system, it can be manually started and used
      for processing licenses with an appropriate OPL_LICENSE_DIR value. A
      generic system startup script is also being developed for Unix
      systems to enable the License Manager process to be automatically
      started on machine boot. If found, product installers will
      automatically append this to your OPL_LICENSE_DIR variable.

      The OpenLink License Manager sends and receives using the multicast
      IP address 224.0.0.24 on port 60001/udp to communicate between
      components and other license-managers that might be on your network.
      In the event that it cannot establish this multicast communication,
      it may cease allocating licenses, so in the event of license
      allocation-related errors, please check your firewall configuration
      permits this traffic.

        <LI><STRONG>Initialization SQL</STRONG> - Lets you specify a
          file containing SQL statements that will be run against the database
          upon connection, automatically.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Cursor Sensitivity</STRONG> - Enables or disables
          the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When dynamic cursor
          sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library calculates checksums for
          each row in the current rowset and compares these with the checksums
          (if any) already stored in the row version cache for the same rows
          when fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the row
          has been updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is
          set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with
          the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user&#39;s point of view,
          the only visible difference between the two sensitivity settings is
          that a row status flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the
          cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as
          SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside, the two
          settings are the same - deleted rows don&#39;t appear in the rowset,
          updates to the row since the row was last fetched are reflected in
          the row data, and inserted rows appear in the rowset if their keys
          fall within the span of the rowset. If your application does not need
          to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the &#39;High
          Cursor Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved.
          The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row fetched
          carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the table oplrvc must
          have been created beforehand using the appropriate script for the
          target database.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>MaxRows Override</STRONG> - Allows you to define
          a limit on the maximum number of rows to returned from a query. The
          default value of 0 means no limit.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable AutoCommit</STRONG> - Change the default
          commit behaviour of the OpenLink Lite Driver. The default mode is
          AutoCommit mode (box unchecked).</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable Rowset Size Limit</STRONG> - Disable the
          limitation enforced by the cursor library. The limitation is enforced
          by default to prevent the Driver claiming all available memory in the
          event that a resultset is generated from an erroneous query is very
          large. The limit is normally never reached.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Defer fetching of long data</STRONG> - Defer
          fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data unless explicitly requested
          in query. This provides significant performance increase when fields
          in query does not include LONG data fields.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Multiple Active Statements Emulation</STRONG> -
          Enables use of Multiple Active statements in an ODBC application even
          if the underlying database does not allow this, as it is emulated in
          the driver.</LI>

        <LI><STRONG>Dynamic Cursor Sensitivity</STRONG> - Enables or

          When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor
          Library calculates checksums for each row in the current
          rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already
          stored in the row version cache for the same rows when
          fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the
          row has been updated since it was last fetched, and the row
          status flag is set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache
          is then updated with the latest checksums for the rowset.
          From the user&#39;s point of view, the only visible difference
          between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status
          flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED, when the cursor
          sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as
          SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside,
          the two settings are the same - deleted rows do not appear in
          the rowset, updates to the row since the row was last fetched
          are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in
          the rowset if their keys fall within the span of the rowset.
          If your application does not need to detect the row status
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the &#39;High Cursor
          Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved.
          The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row
          fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the
          table oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the
          appropriate OpenLink script for the target database.</LI>

          the underlying database does not support retrieving statistics about
          a table (e.g. what indexes there are on it).</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>No support of quoted identifier</STRONG> - If
          it is set, the call SQLGetInfo for &#39;SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR&#39; will
          return the space (&quot; &quot;). It can be used if DBMS doesn&#39;t support quoted
          SQL like select * from &quot;account&quot;</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>No support of search string escape</STRONG> -
          If it is set, the call SQLGetInfo for &#39;SQL_LIKE_ESCAPE_CLAUSE&#39; will
          return the space (&quot; &quot;). It can be used if DBMS doesn&#39;t support SQL
          escape patterns</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Patch of NULL size of SQL_CHAR</STRONG> - If
          set this option overrides the size of SQL_CHAR column type returned
          by the database with the value set in the text box (in bytes). With
          the default value of 0 the driver uses the size returned by the
          database.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>SQL_DBMS Name</STRONG> - Manually override the
          SQLGetInfo(SQL_DBMS_NAME) response returned by the driver. This is
          know to be required for products like Microsoft InfoPath for which

      <UL>
        <LI><STRONG>Initialization SQL</STRONG> - Lets you specify
          a file containing SQL statements that will be run against the
          database upon connection, automatically.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Cursor Sensitivity</STRONG> - Enables or
          disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When
          dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library calculates
          checksums for each row in the current rowset and compares these with
          the checksums (if any) already stored in the row version cache for
          the same rows when fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a
          row, the row has been updated since it was last fetched and the row
          status flag is set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then
          updated with the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user&#39;s
          point of view, the only visible difference between the two
          sensitivity settings is that a row status flag can never be set to
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status
          is instead displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects,
          performance aside, the two settings are the same - deleted rows don&#39;t
          appear in the rowset, updates to the row since the row was last
          fetched are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in
          the rowset if their keys fall within the span of the rowset. If your
          application does not need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED,
          you should leave the &#39;High Cursor Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as
          performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of checksums
          for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled,
          the table oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the
          appropriate script for the target database.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>MaxRows Override</STRONG> - Allows you to
          define a limit on the maximum number of rows to returned from a
          query. The default value of 0 means no limit.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable AutoCommit</STRONG> - Change the
          default commit behaviour of the OpenLink Lite Driver. The default
          mode is AutoCommit mode (box unchecked).</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable Rowset Size Limit</STRONG> - Disable
          the limitation enforced by the cursor library. The limitation is
          enforced by default to prevent the Driver claiming all available
          memory in the event that a resultset is generated from an erroneous
          query is very large. The limit is normally never reached.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Defer fetching of long data</STRONG> - Defer
          fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data unless explicitly requested
          in query. This provides significant performance increase when fields
          in query does not include LONG data fields.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Multiple Active Statements Emulation</STRONG> -
          Enables use of Multiple Active statements in an ODBC application even
          if the underlying database does not allow this, as it is emulated in
          the driver.</LI>

        <LI><STRONG>Cursor Sensitivity</STRONG> - Enables or disables
          the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When dynamic
          cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library calculates
          checksums for each row in the current rowset and compares
          these with the checksums (if any) already stored in the row
          version cache for the same rows when fetched previously. If
          the checksums differ for a row, the row has been updated
          since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with
          the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user&#39;s point of
          view, the only visible difference between the two sensitivity
          settings is that a row status flag can never be set to
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row
          status is instead displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other
          respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same -
          deleted rows don&#39;t appear in the rowset, updates to the row
          since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data,
          and inserted rows appear in the rowset if their keys fall
          within the span of the rowset. If your application does not
          need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should
          leave the &#39;High Cursor Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as
          performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of
          checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this
          option is enabled, the table oplrvc must have been created

          specify a file containing SQL statements that will be run
          against the database upon connection, automatically.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Cursor Sensitivity</STRONG> - Enables or
          disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When
          dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library
          calculates checksums for each row in the current rowset and
          compares these with the checksums (if any) already stored in
          the row version cache for the same rows when fetched
          previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the row has been
          updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is
          set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated
          with the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user&#39;s point
          of view, the only visible difference between the two
          sensitivity settings is that a row status flag can never be set
          to SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row
          status is instead displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other
          respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same -
          deleted rows don&#39;t appear in the rowset, updates to the row
          since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data,
          and inserted rows appear in the rowset if their keys fall
          within the span of the rowset. If your application does not
          need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave
          the &#39;High Cursor Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as
          performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of
          checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this
          option is enabled, the table oplrvc must have been created
          beforehand using the appropriate script for the target
          database.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>MaxRows Override</STRONG> - Allows you to
          define a limit on the maximum number of rows to returned from a
          query. The default value of 0 means no limit.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable AutoCommit</STRONG> -
          Change the default commit behaviour of the OpenLink Lite
          Driver. The default mode is AutoCommit mode (box
          unchecked).</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable Rowset Size Limit</STRONG> -
          Disable the limitation enforced by the cursor library. The
          limitation is enforced by default to prevent the Driver
          claiming all available memory in the event that a resultset is
          generated from an erroneous query is very large. The limit is
          normally never reached.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Defer fetching of long data</STRONG> -
          Defer fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data unless
          explicitly requested in query. This provides significant
          performance increase when fields in query does not include LONG
          data fields.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Multiple Active Statements
            Emulation</STRONG> - Enables use of Multiple Active
          statements in an ODBC application even if the underlying
          database does not allow this, as it is emulated in the

          cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library calculates
          checksums for each row in the current rowset and compares
          these with the checksums (if any) already stored in the row
          version cache for the same rows when fetched previously. If
          the checksums differ for a row, the row has been updated
          since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with
          the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user&#39;s point of
          view, the only visible difference between the two sensitivity
          settings is that a row status flag can never be set to
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row
          status is instead displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other
          respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same -
          deleted rows don&#39;t appear in the rowset, updates to the row
          since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data,
          and inserted rows appear in the rowset if their keys fall
          within the span of the rowset. If your application does not
          need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should
          leave the &#39;High Cursor Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as
          performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of
          checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this
          option is enabled, the table oplrvc must have been created

        <LI><STRONG>Initialization SQL</STRONG> - Lets you
          specify a file containing SQL statements that will be run
          against the database upon connection, automatically.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Cursor Sensitivity</STRONG> - Enables or
          disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When
          dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library
          calculates checksums for each row in the current rowset and
          compares these with the checksums (if any) already stored in
          the row version cache for the same rows when fetched
          previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the row has been
          updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is
          set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated
          with the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user&#39;s point
          of view, the only visible difference between the two
          sensitivity settings is that a row status flag can never be set
          to SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row
          status is instead displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other
          respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same -
          deleted rows don&#39;t appear in the rowset, updates to the row
          since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data,
          and inserted rows appear in the rowset if their keys fall
          within the span of the rowset. If your application does not
          need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave
          the &#39;High Cursor Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as
          performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of
          checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this
          option is enabled, the table oplrvc must have been created
          beforehand using the appropriate script for the target
          database.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>MaxRows Override</STRONG> - Allows you to
          define a limit on the maximum number of rows to returned from a
          query. The default value of 0 means no limit.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable AutoCommit</STRONG> - Change the
          default commit behaviour of the OpenLink Lite Driver. The
          default mode is AutoCommit mode (box unchecked).</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable Rowset Size Limit</STRONG> -
          Disable the limitation enforced by the cursor library. The
          limitation is enforced by default to prevent the Driver
          claiming all available memory in the event that a resultset is
          generated from an erroneous query is very large. The limit is
          normally never reached.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Defer fetching of long data</STRONG> -
          Defer fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data unless
          explicitly requested in query. This provides significant
          performance increase when fields in query does not include LONG
          data fields.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Multiple Active Statements
            Emulation</STRONG> - Enables use of Multiple Active
          statements in an ODBC application even if the underlying
          database does not allow this, as it is emulated in the
          driver.</LI>

      <UL>
        <LI><STRONG>Dynamic Cursor Sensitivity</STRONG> - Enables or
          disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors.
          When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor
          Library calculates checksums for each row in the current
          rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already
          stored in the row version cache for the same rows when
          fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the
          row has been updated since it was last fetched, and the row
          status flag is set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache
          is then updated with the latest checksums for the rowset.
          From the user&#39;s point of view, the only visible difference
          between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status
          flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED, when the cursor
          sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as
          SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside,
          the two settings are the same - deleted rows do not appear in
          the rowset, updates to the row since the row was last fetched
          are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in
          the rowset if their keys fall within the span of the rowset.
          If your application does not need to detect the row status
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the &#39;High Cursor
          Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved.
          The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row
          fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the
          table oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the
          appropriate OpenLink script for the target database.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>Initialization SQL</STRONG> - Lets you
        specify a file containing SQL statements that will be run against the
        database upon connection, automatically.</LI>
      <UL>
        <LI><STRONG>Cursor Sensitivity</STRONG> - Enables or
          disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors. When
          dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor Library
          calculates checksums for each row in the current rowset and
          compares these with the checksums (if any) already stored in the
          row version cache for the same rows when fetched previously. If
          the checksums differ for a row, the row has been updated since it
          was last fetched and the row status flag is set to
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with the
          latest checksums for the rowset. From the user&#39;s point of view,
          the only visible difference between the two sensitivity settings
          is that a row status flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED
          when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead
          displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance
          aside, the two settings are the same - deleted rows don&#39;t appear
          in the rowset, updates to the row since the row was last fetched
          are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in the
          rowset if their keys fall within the span of the rowset. If your
          application does not need to detect the row status
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the &#39;High Cursor Sensitivity&#39;
          checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved. The calculation
          and comparison of checksums for each row fetched carries an
          overhead. If this option is enabled, the table oplrvc must have
          been created beforehand using the appropriate script for the
          target database.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>MaxRows Override</STRONG> - Allows you to
          define a limit on the maximum number of rows to returned from a
          query. The default value of 0 means no limit.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable AutoCommit</STRONG> - Change the
          default commit behaviour of the OpenLink Express Edition Driver.
          The default mode is AutoCommit mode (box unchecked).</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable Rowset Size Limit</STRONG> - Disable
          the limitation enforced by the cursor library. The limitation is
          enforced by default to prevent the Driver claiming all available
          memory in the event that a resultset is generated from an
          erroneous query is very large. The limit is normally never
          reached.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Defer fetching of long data</STRONG> - Defer
          fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data unless explicitly
          requested in query. This provides significant performance
          increase when fields in query does not include LONG data
          fields.</LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Multiple Active Statements Emulation</STRONG>
          - Enables use of Multiple Active statements in an ODBC

          When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor
          Library calculates checksums for each row in the current
          rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already
          stored in the row version cache for the same rows when
          fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the
          row has been updated since it was last fetched, and the row
          status flag is set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache
          is then updated with the latest checksums for the rowset.
          From the user&#39;s point of view, the only visible difference
          between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status
          flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED, when the cursor
          sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as
          SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside,
          the two settings are the same - deleted rows do not appear in
          the rowset, updates to the row since the row was last fetched
          are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in
          the rowset if their keys fall within the span of the rowset.
          If your application does not need to detect the row status
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the &#39;High Cursor
          Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved.
          The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row
          fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the
          table oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the
          appropriate OpenLink script for the target database.</LI>

          <STRONG>Dynamic cursor sensitivity
          </STRONG> - Enables or
          disables the row version cache used with dynamic cursors.
          When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor
          Library calculates checksums for each row in the current
          rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already
          stored in the row version cache for the same rows when
          fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the
          row has been updated since it was last fetched and the row
          status flag is set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache
          is then updated with the latest checksums for the rowset.
          From the user&#39;s point of view, the only visible difference
          between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status
          flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor
          sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as
          SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside,
          the two settings are the same - deleted rows do not appear in
          the rowset, updates to the row since the row was last fetched
          are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in
          the rowset if their keys fall within the span of the rowset.
          If your application does not need to detect the row status
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the &#39;High Cursor
          Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved.
          The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row
          fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the
          table oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the
          appropriate OpenLink script for the target database.

          </STRONG> - Lets you specify a file containing SQL statements
          that will be run against the database upon connection,
          automatically.
        </LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Cursor Sensitivity</STRONG> - Enables or disables the row version cache used with
          dynamic cursors. When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the
          Cursor Library calculates checksums for each row in the current
          rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already
          stored in the row version cache for the same rows when fetched
          previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the row has been
          updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set
          to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with
          the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user&#39;s point of
          view, the only visible difference between the two sensitivity
          settings is that a row status flag can never be set to
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row
          status is instead displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other
          respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same -
          deleted rows don&#39;t appear in the rowset, updates to the row since
          the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data, and
          inserted rows appear in the rowset if their keys fall within the
          span of the rowset. If your application does not need to detect
          the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the &#39;High Cursor
          Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved. The
          calculation and comparison of checksums for each row fetched
          carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the table oplrvc
          must have been created beforehand using the appropriate script
          for the target database.
        </LI>
        <LI><STRONG>MaxRows Override
          </STRONG> - Allows you to define a limit on the maximum number
          of rows to returned from a query. The default value of 0 means no
          limit.
        </LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable AutoCommit
          </STRONG>
          - Change the default commit behaviour of the OpenLink Lite
          Driver. The default mode is AutoCommit mode (box unchecked).
        </LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Disable Rowset Size Limit
          </STRONG> - Disable the limitation enforced by the cursor
          library. The limitation is enforced by default to prevent the
          Driver claiming all available memory in the event that a
          resultset is generated from an erroneous query is very large. The
          limit is normally never reached.
        </LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Defer fetching of long data
          </STRONG> - Defer fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data
          unless explicitly requested in query. This provides significant
          performance increase when fields in query does not include LONG
          data fields.
        </LI>
        <LI><STRONG>Multiple Active Statements Emulation</STRONG> - Enables use of Multiple Active statements in an
          ODBC application even if the underlying database does not allow
          this, as it is emulated in the driver.

        <LI><STRONG>Dynamic Cursor Sensitivity</STRONG> - Enables or

          When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor
          Library calculates checksums for each row in the current
          rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already
          stored in the row version cache for the same rows when
          fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the
          row has been updated since it was last fetched, and the row
          status flag is set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache
          is then updated with the latest checksums for the rowset.
          From the user&#39;s point of view, the only visible difference
          between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status
          flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED, when the cursor
          sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as
          SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside,
          the two settings are the same - deleted rows do not appear in
          the rowset, updates to the row since the row was last fetched
          are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in
          the rowset if their keys fall within the span of the rowset.
          If your application does not need to detect the row status
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the &#39;High Cursor
          Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as performance is improved.
          The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row
          fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the
          table oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the

          <STRONG>Cursor Sensitivity
          </STRONG> - Enables or disables the row version cache used with
          dynamic cursors. When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the
          Cursor Library calculates checksums for each row in the current
          rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already
          stored in the row version cache for the same rows when fetched
          previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the row has been
          updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with the
          latest checksums for the rowset. From the user&#39;s point of view, the
          only visible difference between the two sensitivity settings is
          that a row status flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the
          cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as
          SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside, the two
          settings are the same - deleted rows don&#39;t appear in the rowset,
          updates to the row since the row was last fetched are reflected in
          the row data, and inserted rows appear in the rowset if their keys
          fall within the span of the rowset. If your application does not
          need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the
          &#39;High Cursor Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as performance is
          improved. The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row
          fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the table
          oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the appropriate
          script for the target database.

        <LI>
          <STRONG>MaxRows Override
          </STRONG> - Allows you to define a limit on the maximum number of
          rows to returned from a query. The default value of 0 means no
          limit.

        <LI>
          <STRONG>Disable AutoCommit
          </STRONG> - Change the default commit behaviour of the OpenLink

        <LI>
          <STRONG>Disable Rowset Size Limit
          </STRONG> - Disable the limitation enforced by the cursor
          library. The limitation is enforced by default to prevent the
          Driver claiming all available memory in the event that a resultset
          is generated from an erroneous query is very large. The limit is
          normally never reached.

        <LI>
          <STRONG>Defer fetching of long data
          </STRONG> - Defer fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data

          When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the Cursor
          Library calculates checksums for each row in the current
          rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already
          stored in the row version cache for the same rows when
          fetched previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the
          row has been updated since it was last fetched, and the row
          status flag is set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache
          is then updated with the latest checksums for the rowset.
          From the user&#39;s point of view, the only visible difference
          between the two sensitivity settings is that a row status
          flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED, when the cursor
          sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as
          SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside,
          the two settings are the same - deleted rows do not appear in
          the rowset, updates to the row since the row was last fetched
          are reflected in the row data, and inserted rows appear in
          the rowset, if their keys fall within the span of the rowset.
          If your application does not need to detect the row status

                are buffered to disk; there is however one exception: each

                memory before this limit is enforced. This means that this

        <LI>
          <STRONG>Cursor Sensitivity
          </STRONG> - Enables or disables the row version cache used with
          dynamic cursors. When dynamic cursor sensitivity is set high, the
          Cursor Library calculates checksums for each row in the current
          rowset and compares these with the checksums (if any) already
          stored in the row version cache for the same rows when fetched
          previously. If the checksums differ for a row, the row has been
          updated since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with the
          latest checksums for the rowset. From the user&#39;s point of view, the
          only visible difference between the two sensitivity settings is
          that a row status flag can never be set to SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the
          cursor sensitivity is low. (The row status is instead displayed as
          SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other respects, performance aside, the two
          settings are the same - deleted rows don&#39;t appear in the rowset,
          updates to the row since the row was last fetched are reflected in
          the row data, and inserted rows appear in the rowset if their keys
          fall within the span of the rowset. If your application does not
          need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should leave the
          &#39;High Cursor Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as performance is
          improved. The calculation and comparison of checksums for each row
          fetched carries an overhead. If this option is enabled, the table
          oplrvc must have been created beforehand using the appropriate
          script for the target database.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <STRONG>MaxRows Override
          </STRONG> - Allows you to define a limit on the maximum number of
          rows to returned from a query. The default value of 0 means no
          limit.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <STRONG>Disable AutoCommit
          </STRONG> - Change the default commit behaviour of the OpenLink
          Lite Driver. The default mode is AutoCommit mode (box unchecked).
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <STRONG>Disable Rowset Size Limit
          </STRONG> - Disable the limitation enforced by the cursor
          library. The limitation is enforced by default to prevent the
          Driver claiming all available memory in the event that a resultset
          is generated from an erroneous query is very large. The limit is
          normally never reached.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <STRONG>Defer fetching of long data
          </STRONG> - Defer fetching of LONG (BINARY, BLOB etc.) data
          unless explicitly requested in query. This provides significant
          performance increase when fields in query does not include LONG
          data fields.

          these with the checksums (if any) already stored in the row
          version cache for the same rows when fetched previously. If
          the checksums differ for a row, the row has been updated
          since it was last fetched and the row status flag is set to
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED. The row version cache is then updated with
          the latest checksums for the rowset. From the user&#39;s point of
          view, the only visible difference between the two sensitivity
          settings is that a row status flag can never be set to
          SQL_ROW_UPDATED when the cursor sensitivity is low. (The row
          status is instead displayed as SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.) In all other
          respects, performance aside, the two settings are the same -
          deleted rows don&#39;t appear in the rowset, updates to the row
          since the row was last fetched are reflected in the row data,
          and inserted rows appear in the rowset if their keys fall
          within the span of the rowset. If your application does not
          need to detect the row status SQL_ROW_UPDATED, you should
          leave the &#39;High Cursor Sensitivity&#39; checkbox unchecked, as
          performance is improved. The calculation and comparison of
          checksums for each row fetched carries an overhead. If this
