  <para>To use OpenLink's TAF event notification features or configure
        the failover retry parameters, you must enable OpenLink's TAF support.
        For the Oracle 10g Multi-Tier Agent, you must set the environment
        variable OPL_TAF_ENABLE to 'Y' or 'y'. With the agent, this is done by
        creating an entry in the appropriate 'Environment' section of the
        OpenLink Request Broker's rulebook, or by navigating through the
        web-based Administrative Assistant (normally running on
        &lt;http://servername:8000/&gt;) to configure an agent by form or
        wizard.</para>
