  <title>OpenLink Multi-Tier Connections using Instant Client</title>
  <para>In this scenario, the Instant Client need only be installed on the
  machine hosting the OpenLink Oracle agent. The valid combinations of
  connection parameters (NET 10 Service Name, Login ID and Password) accepted
  by the OpenLink Multi-Tier DSN Configuration Wizard are the same as detailed
  above for the Single-Tier driver, with the 'NET 10 Service Name' field in
  the multi-tier wizard taking the same values as the 'Connection String'
  field in the single-tier wizard. The environment variables ORACLE_HOME and
  ORACLE_SID need not be set in the rulebook. However, TNS_ADMIN must be set
  in the rulebook if translation of a local NET service name is
  required.</para>
