# Documentation

Documentation Project hosting product and functionality guides using a variety of document types

## Hierarchy

[OpenLink Documentation](https://docs.openlinksw.com/) consists of three broad categories: UDA (Universal Data Access), Virtuoso and more general [wiki-based documentation](https://wikis.openlinksw.com/). Of these, the authoritative documentation for UDA and Virtuoso is in DocBook v5 format.

In this repository, directories exist as follows:

* `uda-docs-source/` - official UDA DocBook sources
* `uda-docs-md/` - generated markdown
* `virtuoso-docs-source/` - official Virtuoso DocBook sources
* `virtuoso-docs-md/` - generated markdown
* `wikis/` - wiki source text
* `wiki-retrive-transform/` - scripts to retrieve and manage wiki content
