        <para>Signals that are marked as <emphasis>NORMAL</emphasis>

   indicate that these signals can be
sent by root or the owner of the virtuoso process to shutdown Virtuoso. The <emphasis>SIGINT</emphasis>

   and
<emphasis>SIGQUIT</emphasis>

   signals also work when Virtuoso is running in background mode and can be used
in shell scripts.</para>
        <para>Signals that are marked as <emphasis>FAULT</emphasis>

   indicate an abnormal condition which should be
checked. If enabled (e.g. with ulimit -c unlimited), the operating system can write a core dump allowing
post-mortem debugging if the Virtuoso executable was compiled with debugging symbols.</para>
        <para>Signals that are marked as <emphasis>IGNORED</emphasis>

   are handled inside Virtuoso.</para>
        <para>The <emphasis>SIGTERM</emphasis>

   signal is mostly used by rc.d type shell scripts on Unix/Linux which
are called during shutdown, but can also be used inside shell scripts.</para>
        <para>The <emphasis>SIGKILL</emphasis>

   signal should only be used as a last resort when all other efforts
to stop Virtuoso have failed.</para>
        <section xml:id="signalsandexitcodessquicksh">
          <title>Quick shutdown</title>
          <para>In quick shutdown mode, Virtuoso will only flush dirty disk buffers, close transaction log and
    	database files and exit to the operating system. Since Virtuoso does not perform a checkpoint, the
    	next startup will take extra time as Virtuoso first needs to perform a rollback and a checkpoint
    	before it can resume operation. The <emphasis>SIGTERM</emphasis>

   signal mostly used by rc.d type
    	scripts on Unix/Linux which are called during shutdown as such instances it is better to quickly
    	finish operations and delay the checkpoint until the next boot.</para>
        </section>
        <section xml:id="signalsandexitcodessquicknsh">
          <title>Normal shutdown</title>
          <para>In normal shutdown mode, Virtuoso will do first do a full checkpoint, then flush dirty disk
    	buffers, close transaction log and database files before exiting to the operating system. Depending
    	on the size of the transaction log this can take some time. The <emphasis>SIGINT</emphasis>

   signal
    	can be used in stop scripts to cleanly shutdown the database by the dba or by root.</para>
          <para>Note that in all cases signals can only be sent by the kernel, the root user or the uid of
    	the person who started Virtuoso. Anyone else that wants to shutdown the Virtuoso instance
    	should use the isql program to connect to Virtuoso and run the 'shutdown' command.</para>
