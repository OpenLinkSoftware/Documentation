        <title>Keeping Page and Session State</title>
        <para>VSPX does not require any particular session management to be in
 effect to operate.  It is in its default form entirely stateless on
 the server side.  There is a mechanism called view state for keeping
 track of data between consecutive post backs of a single page.  This is
 simply an automatically maintained hidden field which will keep the
 state of controls which have a state that may be persisted.  The
 view state mechanism does not however safeguard data across different
 pages but is fine for remembering entered form data or a bookmark in a
 scrolled list across page reloads.</para>
        <para>To keep real sessions and session variables, a
 <computeroutput>v:login</computeroutput>

   control is offered.</para>
