      <title>Identifier Case &amp; Quoting</title>
      <para>Virtuoso can operate with different identifier case conventions.
The CaseMode setting in the virtuoso.ini file controls this, see the
<link linkend="virtini">virtuoso.ini configuration</link>

   section of
the documentation.</para>
      <para>The default files supplied with Virtuoso specify a CaseMode of 2,
which is a case insensitive mode that preserves the declaration case of identifiers.
</para>
      <para>
A CaseMode of 1 specifies the upper case mode, which is most
commonly used in SQL databases, e.g. Oracle.
In the upper case mode, all unquoted identifiers are converted to upper
case by the SQL parser. If identifiers are not quoted, the case in which
they are entered is irrelevant.
</para>
      <para>
The identifier quote character is the double quote (").  Quoted
identifiers are processed in the case they are written in and are thus
case sensitive.
</para>
      <para>
SQL reserved words are case insensitive in all case modes.
</para>
      <para>
If CaseMode is 0 or absent, identifiers will be treated as case sensitive
in all situations, whether quoted or not.
</para>
      <para>
If an identifier's name is equal to a SQL reserved word, e.g. TABLE,
it must be quoted ("TABLE") in order to be used as an identifier.
</para>
      <para>
If an identifier contains non-alphanumeric characters, e.g. space, '-' etc. it
must be quoted regardless of CaseMode.
</para>
      <para>
Although CaseMode can be changed at any time it should only be set at database
creation.  Changing the CaseMode may result in view or procedure code becoming invalid
if it relies on specific case conventions.
