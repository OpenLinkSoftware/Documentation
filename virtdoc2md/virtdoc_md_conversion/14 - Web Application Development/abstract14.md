This chapter deals with the Virtuoso HTTP Server, its Dynamic Page generation and components used to configure it. The HTTP Servers features include: Web server configuration and access control.Multihosting, Virtual Hosting and Virtual Directories - A single Virtuoso server can map requests into multiple spaces of web pages based on the interface to which the requests come (multihosting) or on the Host HTTP/1.1 header (virtual hosting).HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 support, keep alive connections and pipelining.Proxying - Virtuoso can automatically redirect requests to certain resources or directories to another web server.Authentication and security - Specific directories can be made to require authentication (basic or digest) or may be restricted to SSL only. Authentication can also be totally user defined.SOAP - given directories can be defined as containing SOAP services, which can be accessed by SOAP clients, invoking Virtuoso stored procedures.Dynamic content - Given paths can be executable, allowing defining VSP, and VSPX pages that generate HTML or XML using embedded Virtuoso/PL.WebDAV - Paths can be mapped into DAV collections maintained inside the database. Virtuoso WebDav is a Unix file system-like mechanism allows specifying access rights and ownership of DAV resources.WebDAV resources may optionally be indexed in a free text index.A web robot allows copying external web resources into Virtuoso WebDAV.
