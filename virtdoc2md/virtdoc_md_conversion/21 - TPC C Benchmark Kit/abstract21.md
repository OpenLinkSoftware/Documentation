The Virtuoso TPC C Kit is a database benchmark written in C and SQL stored procedures using the CLI or ODBC API. It is modeled after the industry standard Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) C benchmark and can be used as a component in an official benchmark but does not in itself constitute a complete test driver. See Also: A complete description of the benchmark and its metric can be found at the TPC Web Site . This document assumes the reader is familiar with the general content of the benchmark. The C and SQL source of the benchmark is contained in the sample directory of the Virtuoso tree. The tpcc executable is built by running make after choosing the target (see makefile).
