Starting with version 4.5, Virtuoso provides built-in support for SPARQL, the standard query language for RDF and the semantic web. Adoption of SPARQL with Virtuoso is effortless, as any existing SQL client applications and stored procedures can take advantage of SPARQL simply by using it in the place of or inside SQL queries. Additionally, Virtuoso offers the standard SPARQL protocol to HTTP clients. From version 5.0.7, Virtuoso can be used as the RDF store/query processor of the Jena and Sesame RDF frameworks.

This chapter discusses Virtuoso's RDF triple storage and query capabilities. This discusses storing RDF data as well as mapping existing relational data into RDF for SPARQL access. Numerous SPARQL language extensions and standard compliance are covered.

In this chapter SPARQL and SPASQL are used as siblings.
